Save the current development plan to `.claude-plans/calculation-system-refactor.md` in the project root directory.

The plan should be saved in markdown format with clear phase/step organization. Make sure the file is saved in a way that can be easily read and updated later.

After saving, confirm that the plan has been saved successfully.
