description: Run ESLint and optionally fix errors

Run `npm run eslint` from the app directory.

If there are ESLint errors, ask me if I should fix them. If I say yes, fix all the errors and keep running eslint until there are no more errors. If I say no, do nothing.

After everything is done, return to the original directory.
