The Office for Budget Responsibility released updated economic projections alongside the Autumn Budget. These forecasts directly affect PolicyEngine's UK tax-benefit calculations.

Key changes from March to November 2025:

- CPI inflation: 3.2% → 3.5% (2025)
- Average earnings growth: 4.3% → 5.2% (2025)
- Private rent growth: 6.5% → 5.5% (2025)
- Mortgage interest: 14.2% → 11.0% (2025), but 13.3% → 14.4% (2026)

Higher inflation means larger benefit uprating in April 2026-27, but also more fiscal drag from frozen tax thresholds. Higher earnings growth points to larger State Pension increases under the triple lock.

We've updated all OBR-derived parameters in policyengine-uk, extending projections to 2030.
