# Response to Anthony's PR review

Thanks for the thorough review Anthony! I've addressed all the feedback. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Completed changes

### Design tokens implementation
All hardcoded colors have been replaced with design tokens from `designTokens/colors.ts`:
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Updated all color values to use design tokens (primary, gray, border colors)
- **SidebarNavItem.tsx**: Replaced hardcoded colors with semantic tokens
- **SidebarSection.tsx**: Updated text colors to use design tokens
- **SidebarUser.tsx**: Updated avatar and text colors

### Component improvements
- **SidebarDivider component**: Created a new reusable component at `components/sidebar/SidebarDivider.tsx` to standardise the divider styling across the sidebar. This addresses your suggestion about creating a Divider variant.
- **Sidebar width token**: Added `sidebarWidth: '280px'` to the design tokens under `spacing.layout` and updated both Layout.tsx and Sidebar.tsx to reference this token. This enables reuse in the policy parameter selector as you suggested.

### Build configuration
- **Package.json scripts**: Kept the scripts separated as requested. The stylelint step is maintained in the test command chain for better error visibility in GitHub Actions.

## Product decisions needed

### Logo placement question
You raised a good question about the logo placement. The current implementation has the logo within the sidebar, but you're right that the design might intend for it to be in a full-width header. This would be a product/design decision - happy to move it once we confirm the intended layout.

### Reports and calculations pages layout
Your suggestion about moving the reports and calculations pages outside the layout element is noted. This would allow these pages to have different layouts (perhaps full-screen without the sidebar). This is currently non-blocking but worth considering for the product roadmap.

## Note on CLAUDE.md
Regarding your question about multiple CLAUDE.md files - yes, you can have multiple instruction files that Claude can reference. We could definitely create fragments for styling, testing, etc. to keep instructions modular and focused.

All blocking issues have been resolved and the code now consistently uses design tokens throughout the sidebar components.
