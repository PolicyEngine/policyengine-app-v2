# Congressional District GeoJSON Data

## Current File

- **File:** `real_congressional_districts.geojson`
- **Congress:** 118th (used as fallback - boundaries nearly identical to 119th)
- **Source:** US Census Bureau via PolicyEngine/snap-district-map
- **Note:** 119th Congress boundaries differ only in 5 states (AL, GA, LA, NY, NC) due to court-ordered redistricting

## TODO

Update to 119th Congress GeoJSON when a compatible source is found. The Census Bureau shapefiles
convert to GeoJSON but have rendering issues with Plotly choropleths.

## Data Source

Original 118th Congress file from:
https://github.com/PolicyEngine/snap-district-map

## Update Schedule

- **Next update needed:** When 119th Congress compatible GeoJSON is available
- **Decennial redistricting:** After each Census (next: ~2033)
