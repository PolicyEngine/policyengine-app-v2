# Marginal tax rates in California's proposed billionaire tax

Description: The 5% tax creates marginal tax rates between 50% and 60% on wealth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion.

---

On October 21, 2025, labor union SEIU United Healthcare Workers West submitted the ["2026 Billionaire Tax Act"](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf) (California Initiative 25-0024) to California Attorney General Rob Bonta for title and summary preparation. The initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on the net worth as of December 31, 2026 of California residents with wealth exceeding $1 billion.

The tax structure creates marginal tax rates on wealth between 50% and 60% during the $1.0-$1.1 billion phase-in range. This occurs because the tax applies to total wealth rather than only wealth exceeding $1 billion, causing rate increases to affect all accumulated wealth.

## The phase-in mechanism

The statutory text specifies:

> For individuals and trusts on whom tax is imposed... the tax imposed is 5 percent of the net worth of such individual or trust. In the case of an individual (other than a trust) having net worth less than $1.1 billion ($1,100,000,000), the tax imposed by this Section shall be reduced by 0.1 percentage point (but not below zero) for each $2 million ($2,000,000) by which such person's net worth falls below $1.1 billion ($1,100,000,000).

[Interactive: phase in]

This creates a stepwise rate schedule. At exactly $1.0 billion, the tax rate is 0% and total tax is $0. At $1.1 billion, the rate reaches 5% and total tax is $55 million. Taxpayers can spread payments over five years, though the liability remains based on wealth as of December 31, 2026 regardless of subsequent wealth changes.

## Total tax liability

Multiplying wealth by the tax rate yields total tax liability. For example, at $1.1 billion, the 5% rate produces $55 million in tax ($1.1B × 5% = $55M). At $2.0 billion, the tax is $100 million ($2.0B × 5% = $100M). The chart below shows the full tax liability schedule.

[Interactive: liability]

## Marginal tax rates

The marginal tax rate measures how much additional tax results from a wealth increase. It equals the change in tax divided by the change in wealth.

Because the tax applies to total wealth rather than only wealth above $1 billion, each 0.1 percentage point rate increase applies to all accumulated wealth, creating marginal rates between 50% and 60% in the phase-in range.

| Initial wealth | Initial rate | Initial tax | New wealth | New rate | New tax | Change in wealth | Change in tax | Marginal rate |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| $1.000B        | 0.0%         | $0M         | $1.1B      | 5.0%     | $55.0M  | $100M            | $55.0M        | 55%           |
| $1.000B        | 0.0%         | $0M         | $1.002B    | 0.1%     | $1.0M   | $2M              | $1.0M         | 50%           |
| $1.098B        | 4.9%         | $53.8M      | $1.100B    | 5.0%     | $55.0M  | $2M              | $1.2M         | 60%           |
| $1.100B        | 5.0%         | $55.0M      | $1.102B    | 5.0%     | $55.1M  | $2M              | $0.1M         | 5%            |

[Interactive: mtr]

The marginal rate increases from 50% to 60% across the 50 discrete $2 million increments in the phase-in range, averaging 55%. Above $1.1 billion, the marginal rate drops to 5%.

The initiative requires [874,641 valid signatures](https://ballotpedia.org/California_2026_ballot_propositions) by June 25, 2026 to qualify for the November 2026 ballot.

# How we used Claude Code to choose our DC office
Slug: dc-office-ai-coding
Date: 2025-10-05
Authors: Max Ghenis, Daphne Hansell
Tags: us, org, ai
Description: We used Claude Code to build an interactive comparison tool for choosing our DC office. The winner: Open Gov Hub. Join us Oct 22 to celebrate!

---

When we needed a new DC office, we started like most organizations do: a Google Doc listing pros and cons of different coworking spaces. Then we realized we could make a better decision by turning it into a software project.

## From spreadsheet to interactive comparison

Using Claude Code, we built a [complete microsite](https://policyengine.github.io/dc-office-comparison/) to compare eight DC coworking spaces. The site includes interactive maps, detailed comparison tables, and transit analysis for our team members' commute patterns.

The most interesting feature: we used the Google Maps API to calculate actual travel times from our core DC team members' locations. This transformed subjective "centrally located" claims into objective data we could compare across options.

## What AI coding agents unlocked

This continues a pattern we've observed: when you frame any problem as a software project, AI coding agents can unleash their full creative potential. Instead of static notes, we got:

- Interactive Leaflet.js maps showing each space's location
- Structured comparison data across price, amenities, and accessibility
- Real commute time calculations for our team
- A reusable tool for future office decisions

One unexpected challenge: Claude Code (using Opus 4.1 at the time) developed a strong preference for Open Gov Hub. We had to explicitly request more objective analysis to get balanced comparisons. The newer Sonnet 4.5 model we now use shows less of this behavior.

## The result

We moved into the [Open Gov Hub](https://www.opengovhub.org/). The [microsite](https://policyengine.github.io/dc-office-comparison/) helped us make the decision systematically. Open Gov Hub stood out for its mission alignment—housing 40+ civic tech and policy organizations—combined with practical advantages: central location with 23-minute metro access from our Arlington team members, 10-minute bike ride from our DC-based staff, competitive pricing for dedicated desks, and membership in a global coworking network. The space includes a balcony and conference rooms, and we're already planning policy-focused events with the other organizations in the building.

![PolicyEngine team at the Open Gov Hub](/images/posts/open-gov-hub-team.jpg)

## Join us

Our DC team (Max, Daphne, Pavel, and David) is hosting an officewarming with bites and drinks. This one's just for fun.

**When:** Wednesday, October 22, 5:30-7:30 PM

**Where:** Open Gov Hub, 1100 13th St NW, Washington, DC 20005

# Introducing ACA-Calc: Calculate your household's premium tax credits
Slug: introducing-aca-calc
Date: 2025-09-30
Authors: Daphne Hansell
Tags: us, policy, featured, healthcare, interactives
Description: New interactive calculator shows how Affordable Care Act subsidies affect households under current enhanced schedule and original schedule.

---

The enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. We're launching [**ACA-Calc**](../aca-calc) — an interactive calculator that estimates premium tax credits for individual households.

[**_Calculate your household's premium tax credits here._**](../aca-calc)

## What the tool does

ACA-Calc allows users to estimate Affordable Care Act premium tax credits for any household configuration. The tool calculates subsidies under the enhanced schedule (the subsidies enacted through the American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025) and the original schedule (the subsidy levels that would apply if enhancements expire). The tool shows side-by-side comparisons of how the two policy scenarios affect household premiums and subsidy eligibility.

## Example

Consider a married couple in West Virginia, ages 60 and 64, with no dependents and an annual household income of $63,450.

Their base Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan is $49,687 per year ($4,141 per month).

Under the enhanced schedule (2026 with IRA), they would receive $45,880 in annual premium tax credits. Under the original schedule (2026 after expiration), they would receive $43,659 in annual premium tax credits.

When the IRA enhancements expire, their premium tax credits would decrease by $2,221 per year ($185 per month).

**Healthcare Assistance by Household Income showing premium tax credits with and without IRA enhancements**

![](/images/posts/aca-calc-chart.png)

## Key features

The calculator accepts detailed household information including location (state and county for accurate benchmark premium data), household Modified Adjusted Gross Income, family composition (number and ages of household members), and filing status (single or married).

Users can compare outcomes across two scenarios: the enhanced schedule (current law through 2025) and the original schedule (pre-2021 baseline if enhancements expire).

For each scenario, the tool displays the annual premium tax credit (total subsidy amount), monthly premium tax credit (subsidy divided across 12 months), premium percentage cap (maximum premium as percentage of income), benchmark premium (second-lowest-cost Silver plan in your area), and required contribution (amount paid toward premiums).

The tool provides instant recalculation as you adjust household income levels, number of household members, ages of family members, and geographic location. ACA-Calc includes benchmark premium data for all counties across the United States.

## How it works

The calculator implements the ACA premium tax credit formula using PolicyEngine's validated rules engine. First, it determines household size and income relative to the Federal Poverty Line. Next, it looks up the benchmark premium (second-lowest-cost Silver plan) for your county. The calculator then calculates the applicable percentage from the premium cap schedule and computes your required contribution as that percentage of income. Finally, it subtracts your contribution from the benchmark premium to determine the credit amount.

The tool applies the same calculation methods used in PolicyEngine's full microsimulation model, which has been validated against official sources including Internal Revenue Service data.

## Policy context

The enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the enhancements expire, marketplace enrollment would decrease by approximately 3.4 million people.

For households purchasing coverage through ACA marketplaces, the difference between the enhanced and original subsidy schedules affects annual subsidy amounts, premium contribution requirements as a percentage of income, and subsidy eligibility thresholds.

## Get started

ACA-Calc is available at [**policyengine.org/us/aca-calc**](../aca-calc). To use the calculator, enter your household's basic information (state, county, income, size), review your premium tax credit under each schedule, compare the enhanced versus original subsidy amounts, and adjust household parameters to see how credits change.

Description: PolicyEngine analyzes extending the enhanced premium tax credits enacted through the American Rescue Plan Act beyond their 2025 expiration.

---

In March 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the [American Rescue Plan Act ](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319), which temporarily enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage. The [Inflation Reduction Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text) then extended these enhancements through December 31, 2025. On September 4, 14 representatives introduced H.R.5145, the [Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5145), which would extend the enhanced subsidies through 2026. Additionally, Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) introduced a [continuing resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5450) to extend current government funding levels through October 31, 2025, while permanently extending the enhanced subsidies.

In this report, we use the [PolicyEngine ACA microsimulation model](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/blob/master/docs/gov/hhs/aca.md) to simulate extending the enhanced premium tax credits in 2026, showing their effects on archetypical households' net income and marginal tax rates.

_See how this reform would affect your household [here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=83726)_

## Background

The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), and then the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), made two primary changes to the Premium Tax Credit (PTC) structure:

1. **Removed the 400% Federal Poverty Line income eligibility limit**: Pre-2021 law restricted PTCs to households with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. The enhancement extended eligibility to all income levels with a cap on premium contributions.

1. **Modified the applicable percentage table**: The enhancement reduced the percentage of income that households must contribute toward benchmark plan premiums across all income levels, as shown in Table 1.

**Table 1: Applicable-percentage schedule used to calculate Marketplace premium tax credits**

| Household Income (% FPL) | Premium Cap - Original Schedule | Premium Cap - Enhanced (2021-2025) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Under 133%               | 2.10%                           | 0%                                 |
| 133% to 150%             | 3.14% to 4.19%                  | 0% to 2%                           |
| 150% - <200%             | 4.19% to 6.60%                  | 0% to 2%                           |
| 200% - <250%             | 6.60% to 8.44%                  | 2% to 4%                           |
| 250% - <300%             | 8.44% to 9.96%                  | 4% to 6%                           |
| 300% - ≤400%             | 9.96%                           | 6% to 8.5%                         |
| >400%                    | Not eligible for PTC            | 8.5%                               |

## Household Impacts

Household impacts vary by state, age, and household composition, because the Affordable Care Act (ACA) sets subsidies based on the price of the Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan (SLCSP) in a given rating area (ordinarily a group of counties).

These examples represent opposite ends of ACA implementation across states. Texas demonstrates the simplest case: without Medicaid expansion, only federal PTCs apply, allowing us to isolate the impact of enhanced credit expiration. New York shows the most complex interactions: with Medicaid expansion, households navigate between Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and PTCs as income rises, with eligibility thresholds creating distinct coverage cliffs at different income levels.

## Example 1: 25 and 28 year old married couple in Austin, Texas

Because [Texas has not expanded Medicaid to the adult population](https://www.kff.org/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/), this two-person household receives no healthcare benefits until their income reaches 138% of the federal poverty line ($29,187). Without children, they also do not qualify for CHIP. Table 2 below shows the PTC level at select levels of the poverty line.

**Table 2: Net Income Change for Texas Household**

| Percentage of the Federal Poverty Line | Income  | ACA PTC under Expiration | ACA PTC under Extension | Difference In Premium Tax Credit | Notes                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 138%                                   | $29,187 | $9,128                   | $10,090                 | $962                             | Lowest eligible income       |
| 300%                                   | $63,450 | $4,062                   | $6,283                  | $2,221                           | Enhanced subsidies           |
| 400%                                   | $84,600 | $0                       | $2,899                  | $2,899                           | Ineligible under current law |

Figure 1 shows these PTC values in 2026 under current law and extension of enhanced subsidies for income levels through $200,000. They would be eligible for a nonzero PTC at income of $84,600 under current law, and $119,162 under extension.

_Code for the Figures can be found [here](https://github.com/daphnehanse11/analysis-notebooks/blob/nyt-health/us/medicaid/aca_reform_households.ipynb)_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2700/1*Kj67fxnHvs9m62xRSauF5Q.png)

Figure 2 shows the additional PTC resulting from extension, peaking at $2,899 at $84,600 income, the 400% income level where they lose eligibility under current law.

Finally, Figure 3 shows the marginal tax rate (MTR) under each scenario. Extending the enhanced subsidies would reduce MTRs in the current phase-out range, since it phases out more slowly, while increasing them in the income range where they are ineligible under current law but still phasing out under extension.

_Note: The household faces a negative infinite MTR at 138% FPL, where they become eligible for the PTC in both scenarios, and a positive infinite MTR at 400% FPL under current law, where they become ineligible for the PTC._

## Example 2: A family of 3 in New York with two 40 year old married parents and one 3 year old dependent

Because [New York expanded Medicaid to adults,](https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/publications/adm/13adm3.htm) this family's healthcare coverage varies by income level:

**Below 154% FPL ($41,041):** The entire family qualifies for Medicaid. We value this coverage at $16,480 based on New York's per-capita Medicaid costs for each enrollment group (adults and children). No PTC is available since they have Medicaid coverage.

**At 200% FPL ($53,300):** Parents remain on Medicaid ($12,930) while the child transitions to CHIP ($2,489). No PTC is available.

**At 300% FPL ($79,950):** Parents lose Medicaid eligibility. Under current law, the family receives $13,847 in PTCs (65% of their $21,442 benchmark premium). With the extension, PTCs increase to $16,645 (78% of premium). The child is still eligible for CHIP ($2,489).

**At 406% FPL ($111,000):** Current law eliminates all PTC support — the family pays the full premium. The child is no longer eligible for CHIP. The extension would provide $21,135 in PTCs for the entire family (57% of premium costs).

Table 3 below shows the households healthcare benefits at select levels of the poverty line.

**Table 3: Net Income Change for New York Household**

| Income   | Percentage of the Federal Poverty Line | ACA PTC under Expiration | ACA PTC under Extension | Medicaid Expenditure | CHIP Expenditure per Capita | Difference In Premium Tax Credit | Notes                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| $41,100  | 154%                                   | $0                       | $0                      | $16,480              | $0                          | $0                               | Entire Family on Medicaid                            |
| $53,300  | 200%                                   | $0                       | $0                      | $12,930              | $2,489                      | $0                               | Child in CHIP                                        |
| $79,950  | 300%                                   | $13,847                  | $16,645                 | $0                   | $2,489                      | $2,798                           | Parents in ACA, Child in CHIP                        |
| $111,000 | 406%                                   | $0                       | $21,135                 | $0                   | $0                          | $21,135                          | Ineligible for any health benefits under current law |

Figure 4 shows these elements as a continuous function of earnings.

**Figure 4: Change in Healthcare Benefits Based on Household Earnings (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2700/1*jsNet9bhFayg7EjtUgFm9w.png)

Figure 5 shows the additional PTC resulting from extension, and how it interacts with other healthcare benefits. The household's PTC peaks at 406% of the federal poverty level, when the child loses CHIP eligibility. They would be eligible for a nonzero PTC at income of $111,000 under current law and $359,000 under extension.

**Figure 5: Change in Healthcare Benefits Based on Household Earnings (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2700/1*rG9ozTvBHduuihneLKwqEA.png)

Figure 6 shows the marginal tax rate (MTR) under each scenario. Extending the enhanced subsidies would reduce MTRs in the current phase-out range, while increasing them in the income range where they are ineligible under current law but still phasing out under extension. The family faces two high marginal tax rates under the baseline, one at 400% of the federal poverty level when the parents lose ACA eligibility, and the other at 405% of the federal poverty level when the child loses CHIP eligibility.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2700/1*McWhTwfZGLE2H_7Gb0xxTQ.png)

## Conclusion

Extension of the enhanced premium tax credits beyond 2025 would increase subsidies across all eligible income levels and maintain eligibility for households above 400% of the federal poverty line. Our PolicyEngine microsimulation shows varying impacts by state and household composition: the Texas couple would gain $2,899 in annual credits at 400% FPL, while the New York family would gain $12,268 at 405% FPL.

In future reports, we will estimate the budgetary and distributional impacts of this and other ACA-related reform proposals.

# PolicyEngine and NBER sign memorandum of understanding for TAXSIM emulator development
Slug: policyengine-nber-mou-taxsim
Date: 2025-09-05
Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, org, featured
Description: Partnership ensures continuity of tax microsimulation capabilities for the research community through open-source development.

---

We're excited to announce that PolicyEngine has partnered with the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://nber.org) to ensure researchers worldwide continue to have access to critical tax microsimulation tools. Through our [memorandum of understanding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5TJk7C01CLYP_FXUZTmHEdLk-WCV4WN/view?usp=sharing), we're building an open-source emulator of [TAXSIM](https://taxsim.nber.org), NBER's tax calculator that has powered academic research and government policy analysis for nearly five decades.

## Why TAXSIM matters

Since the 1970s, TAXSIM has set the gold standard for tax microsimulation. Daniel Feenberg, NBER's IT Director, created and maintains this tool that enables groundbreaking research on everything from tax reform impacts to income inequality. [Over 1,200 papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=14430205938320153579&as_sdt=20000005&sciodt=0,21&hl=en) have applied TAXSIM, based on citations of the [Feenberg and Coutts (1993)](https://taxsim.nber.org/feenberg-coutts.pdf) paper that introduces the model. Beyond academic citations, major think tanks rely on TAXSIM — researchers at Brookings [use it extensively](https://www.brookings.edu/research/simulating-income-tax-liabilities-in-the-survey-of-consumer-finances/) to analyze tax policy impacts. Federal agencies also depend on TAXSIM: the Bureau of Labor Statistics [uses it for the Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/improving-data-quality-in-ce-with-taxsim.htm), and the Census Bureau has evaluated it for the Supplemental Poverty Measure.

TAXSIM35, the current version, accepts 35 input variables covering demographics, labor income, capital income, deductions, and credits. It calculates not just federal and state tax liabilities but also taxable income, specific credits, payroll taxes, and other detailed tax components. With coverage of federal tax law from 1960 to present and state tax laws from 1977 onward, TAXSIM helps researchers understand exactly how tax changes affect real families across six decades of American tax policy.

## Our collaboration with NBER

We're working directly with Daniel Feenberg and James Poterba, President and CEO of NBER, to build the next generation of tax microsimulation tools. This MOU formalizes the validation work we've been doing against TAXSIM for over three years while building state tax models across the country. Dr. Feenberg also serves as an external mentor through our [NSF POSE Phase I grant](https://policyengine.org/us/research/nsf-pose-phase-1-grant), helping us build a robust open-source ecosystem for policy analysis.

Our partnership ensures that:

- Researchers maintain uninterrupted access to tax microsimulation capabilities
- The tool evolves with modern features while preserving backward compatibility
- The codebase becomes open-source, enabling community contributions and transparency

## What we're building

We're developing the TAXSIM emulator as a fully open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-taxsim). The emulator leverages PolicyEngine's existing US federal and state tax calculator to replicate TAXSIM's functionality.

**Key features of the emulator:**

- Full compatibility with TAXSIM's existing input and output formats
- Open-source codebase for transparency and community contributions
- Built on PolicyEngine's validated state and federal tax models from 2021 onward
- Integration with TAXSIM to provide a unified interface across all years (1960-present)
- A new dashboard for comparing results across thousands of tax scenarios

Both organizations rigorously validate the emulator to ensure it matches TAXSIM's outputs exactly. Dr. Feenberg provides technical guidance throughout the development process, ensuring we capture every detail that makes TAXSIM so valuable to the research community.

Through this detailed validation process, we've already identified opportunities to improve how both TAXSIM and PolicyEngine encode complex tax laws — not just at the federal level, but across all 50 states and DC. This collaboration strengthens both tools, ensuring researchers get the most accurate tax calculations possible.

## The path forward

Our organizations designed a smooth transition plan. The integrated system will combine TAXSIM and the PolicyEngine-based emulator, allowing researchers to use a familiar interface for any year from 1960 to present. Behind the scenes, the system will route calculations to TAXSIM for historical years and to the open-source emulator for recent years (2021 onward).

We aim to launch this integrated tool later this year, along with a dashboard that will allow users to compare results across thousands of tax scenarios. Researchers will experience no disruption — they'll continue using the same interface while gaining access to open-source capabilities for recent tax years.

## What this means for the research community

This partnership goes beyond maintaining existing tools — we're expanding access to rigorous policy analysis. Making tax microsimulation open-source and adding modern features allows us to:

- Enable more researchers to contribute to and validate the codebase
- Help new researchers learn and use these tools more easily
- Ensure these capabilities remain available for decades to come
- Create opportunities for innovation in tax policy analysis

We're honored to work with NBER to carry forward Dr. Feenberg's decades of work on TAXSIM. Together, we're ensuring that the next generation of researchers and policymakers have even better tools to understand how tax policies affect families across the income spectrum.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue development. If you're interested in contributing or have questions about the project, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-taxsim) or reach out to us directly.

# National Science Foundation awards PolicyEngine $300,000 grant
Slug: nsf-pose-phase-1-grant
Date: 2025-08-18
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, uk, org, featured
Description: NSF's Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems program will support PolicyEngine's work to expand access to policy analysis tools.

---

PolicyEngine has been awarded a $300,000 Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation's [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) ([Award No. 2518372](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2518372)). This grant will support our work to strengthen and expand the open-source ecosystem around economic policy analysis tools.

## Award abstract

This Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) project increases access to sophisticated economic policy analysis tools, enabling evidence-based decision-making across all levels of American society. The project transforms tax-benefit microsimulations into open-source infrastructure accessible to local governments, nonprofits, and citizens. This innovation enhances scientific understanding by making policy models transparent and reproducible, allowing researchers to validate assumptions and build upon existing work. The OSE provides durable competitive advantage by establishing the United States as the global leader in open-source policy modeling. The model leverages distributed open-source development, where commercial users fund expansions that benefit the entire ecosystem. Primary beneficiaries include households accessing benefits, local governments analyzing policy impacts, and researchers advancing economic science.

This POSE project addresses the critical gap between sophisticated policy analysis capabilities and organizational infrastructure needed for sustainable open-source development. While the team has built comprehensive tax-benefit microsimulation tools with a strong user base, transitioning to a self-sustaining ecosystem requires systematic organizational development. The project's objectives include: 1) conducting ecosystem discovery to map stakeholder needs; 2) establishing a new governance structure; and 3) building contributor infrastructure including documentation, mentorship programs, and community engagement frameworks. The effort involves surveying stakeholders, conducting focus groups, developing governance bylaws, creating contributor onboarding systems, and launching a dashboard tracking ecosystem health. Technical goals include a comprehensive ecosystem landscape report, formalized intellectual property frameworks (e.g., AGPL-3.0 code, trademark protection, contributor agreements), documented partnership models, and quantitative metrics showing increasing contribution rates and growth in monthly users. This organizational infrastructure ensures PolicyEngine's technical capabilities, including state and congressional district-level analysis powered by machine learning calibration, can sustainably serve community interests and drive development.

## About the POSE program

The NSF POSE program helps open-source projects develop robust ecosystems with strong governance, community engagement, and technical infrastructure. Phase I focuses on ecosystem discovery and planning, while Phase II provides implementation funding for projects ready to scale their impact.

## Project activities

Our grant activities focus on three key areas:

### Ecosystem discovery and research

- Conduct 100+ stakeholder interviews to understand the needs of policy researchers, government agencies, nonprofits, and academic institutions
- Map the landscape of policy analysis tools and identify gaps in current capabilities
- Study successful open-source economic modeling projects to learn best practices

### Community building and engagement

- Attend and present at key conferences to engage with the policy analysis community
- Develop partnerships with organizations that can contribute to and benefit from our tools
- Create documentation and resources to lower barriers for new contributors

### Governance development

- Design governance structures that support transparent decision-making and community involvement
- Develop sustainable funding models that align with our open-source mission
- Create processes for managing contributions and maintaining code quality

## Learning from TAXSIM's success

Dr. Dan Feenberg, creator of TAXSIM (cited in over 1,100 academic publications), will serve as our external mentor through the I-Corps for POSE training. TAXSIM has successfully built a large user community at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and we'll learn from their decades of experience creating an ecosystem around tax microsimulation tools. Many current TAXSIM users are potential PolicyEngine users, and Dr. Feenberg is helping us understand how to best serve this community's needs.

## Conference participation

As part of our ecosystem discovery efforts, we'll be attending and presenting at major conferences in economics, public policy, and open-source software development. These events will help us engage with potential users and contributors, learn from other projects, and share our work with the broader community.

# Analysis of the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025
Slug: american-worker-rebate-act
Date: 2025-08-13
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, tariffs, featured
Description: The bill would cost $141 billion and benefit 80% of American residents.

---

On July 29th, Senator Josh Hawley [introduced](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hawley-American-Worker-Rebate-Act-Bill-Text.pdf) the American Worker Rebate Act (AWRA) of 2025. The legislation would send a "tariff rebate" of at least $600 per person to households below certain income thresholds and with a valid Social Security Number (SSN).[^1] We at PolicyEngine have analyzed this bill and determined its impact on American households and the overall economy.

Our microsimulation model, assuming no changes to economic conditions, projects these impacts:

- Estimated federal cost of $141 billion

- Would benefit 80% of U.S. residents

- Projected to reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 6.9%

- Expected to reduce the Gini index of inequality by 1.1%

_Use PolicyEngine to [view the full results](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462) or calculate the [effect on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462)._

## How the rebate works

The American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 follows a similar structure to the economic impact payments (commonly known as "stimulus checks") disbursed in 2020 and 2021. Families would receive direct payments in 2026 based on their 2024 tax return (or 2023 if that information is unavailable). For our analysis, we simulate over the tax year 2024 and assume every tax unit filed a return that year.

The head of each household must have a valid SSN in order for their tax unit to be eligible for any benefits. For married couples, both spouses must have an SSN, unless one is in the armed services. In this case, only one spouse needs an SSN.[^2] Children without a valid SSN cannot receive individual payments, but this does not disqualify the rest of the tax unit from receiving benefits.

Eligible households receive the full payment if their adjusted gross income (AGI) falls below $112,500 for head-of-household filers, $150,000 for joint filers, and $75,000 for all other filing statuses. Payments are reduced by $5 for every $100 of income above these thresholds. The base rebate is $600 per person; however, if total tariff revenue generates more than $600 per capita nationwide, the rebate amount would be increased to match this higher figure. We use the $600 rebate value for our analysis.

## Household impacts

Let's examine how the AWRA's tariff rebates could affect a hypothetical U.S. family. A married couple in Florida with two children earning $100,000 would receive the [full $2,400 rebate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462&household=55185) in 2026, assuming all family members have valid SSNs. However, if one parent does not meet the SSN requirement and does not qualify for the armed services exception, the entire household is ineligible and [receives no benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462&household=55186). If one child lacks a valid SSN, the household still qualifies [for $1,800](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462&household=55197), the full amount minus $600 for the ineligible child.

Additionally, if household earnings were to rise to $160,000, then the $2,400 benefit would [fall to $1,900](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462&household=55199) as the rebate phaseout would now apply. The entire benefit would phase out once the household's AGI [reaches $198,000](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462&household=55200).[^3] Table 1 summarizes the benefit amounts for each household scenario.

**Table 1: Summary of Household Impacts for a Married Couple with Two Children**

| Earnings | Both Adults Have Valid SSNs? | Children Have Valid SSN? | Rebate Amount |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| $100,000 | Yes                          | Yes                      | $2,400        |
| $100,000 | No                           | Yes                      | $0            |
| $100,000 | Yes                          | Only one child           | $1,800        |
| $160,000 | Yes                          | Yes                      | $1,900        |
| $198,000 | Yes                          | Yes                      | $0            |

Figure 1 displays how net income varies as employment income rises from $0 to $200,000 for the examined tax unit. The household receives the $2,400 tariff rebate until reaching $150,000, when the phase-out begins. Reducing by 5%, the rebate falls to zero at $198,000 of AGI, leaving net income unchanged above this point.

**Figure 1: Net Income by Household Income for a Married Couple with Two Children**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*hnuDJEzEZ3ozxnWR)

Figure 2 shows how the AWRA alters the household's marginal tax rates. The household would see its marginal tax rates rise from 29.7% to 34.7% once its AGI reaches $150,000 and 5% phase-out applies. Once AGI reaches $198,000 and the rebate is fully phased out, their change in marginal tax rates reverts to 23.4%, the current value under the baseline.

## Microsimulation results

Using data from tax year 2024, the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 [would cost $141.3 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462), according to PolicyEngine's static modeling. Due to interactions with state tax codes, the AWRA would also raise $58.9 million in state and local tax revenue.

The legislation would [raise the net income of 80.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462) of residents in the U.S, though the degree to which they benefit varies by income decile. Overall, 30% of residents would experience a gain of more than 5% of their net income, including 93% of those in the lowest income decile. In the top income decile, 41% of residents would see a gain (all amounting to less than 5% in their net income).

**Figure 3: Winners of the AWRA's Tariff Rebates**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uFiy--rmBE7w_6L-)

The [average household benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462) of the AWRA would be $973. The decile experiencing the largest gain is the seventh ($1,273), while the tenth would benefit the least with an average benefit of $469. This is due to the phaseout of the rebates.

**Figure 4: Average Benefit of the AWRA's Tariff Rebates**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bIQjYwzSnpQLt6Iw)

We project the AWRA to [lower poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462), as defined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure, by 6.9%, with seniors seeing the largest reduction at 11.7%. Deep poverty would [fall by 7.5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462), including a 15.2% reduction in deep child poverty.

**Figure 5: Poverty Impact of the AWRA' Tariff Rebates**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*qSsl1Vo4_4slkDjA)

The proposed legislation would also [lower the Gini index of inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&reform=89462) by 1.07%, and lower the share of net income held by the top 10% and 1% households by 0.8% and 0.84%, respectively.

## Conclusion

The American Worker Rebate Act of 2025 would send direct payments to qualifying families, which would cost $141.3 billion, using data from tax year 2024. The tariff rebates would provide an average benefit of $973 to households, with those in the seventh decile experiencing the largest gain. The bill is expected to reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 6.9% and lower the Gini index of income inequality by 1.07%.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

We invite you to explore our [additional analyses](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/research) and use [PolicyEngine](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us) to calculate your own tax benefits or design custom policy reforms.

[^1]: Qualifying persons include the head and spouse of the household and any CTC-qualifying children. Adult dependents are not eligible for payments.

[^2]: Our analysis does not include the armed services exemption. We assume that if a head or spouse does not have a valid SSN, their tax unit is ineligible for the rebates.

[^3]: The rebate phases out at 5% above the joint income threshold for the examined household. At $160,000, the household rebate value falls by $500 since their AGI is $10,000 over the limit (5% of $10,000 is $500). At $198,000 of AGI, their rebate falls to zero (5% of $48,000 is $2,400).

# Enhanced CPS full launch: Comprehensive microdata for policy analysis
Slug: enhanced-cps-launch
Date: 2025-08-11
Authors: Max Ghenis, Nikhil Woodruff, Ben Ogorek, Maria Juaristi
Tags: us, data, featured
Description: The Enhanced Current Population Survey now includes tip, overtime, and auto loan interest imputations, plus upcoming state and congressional district calibration.

---

We're excited to announce the full launch of the Enhanced Current Population Survey (Enhanced CPS). This comprehensive dataset powers PolicyEngine's microsimulation modeling with unprecedented accuracy, enabling precise analysis of tax and benefit reforms across the United States.

Building on extensive development and testing since our [beta launch](/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta), the Enhanced CPS now includes sophisticated imputation models for income sources and household characteristics that were previously unavailable or underreported in survey data. These improvements provide a more complete picture of American households' economic circumstances. Learn more about our [methodology](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology) and [data sources](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/data).

## New features

### Income source imputations

The Enhanced CPS now includes machine learning-based imputations for income sources that are frequently underreported in surveys:

**Tip income**: Using employer-reported data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we impute tip income based on employment income, age, and household composition. This enhancement enables accurate analysis of proposals to exempt tips from taxation. See our [imputation methodology documentation](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology#imputation) for technical details.

**Overtime premiums**: We calculate overtime income using hours worked, occupation codes, and Fair Labor Standards Act exemption status, allowing accurate modeling of overtime exemption proposals.

**Auto loan interest**: Imputed from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), this addition enables analysis of proposals to make auto loan interest deductible.

### Immigration status imputation

We've implemented the ASEC Undocumented Algorithm to impute Social Security Number card types, enabling more accurate modeling of policies with citizenship or work authorization requirements. This process-of-elimination approach examines 14 conditions to identify likely undocumented individuals, calibrated to match external population estimates. Details are available in our [demographic imputation section](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology#demographic-imputation).

### Technical infrastructure improvements

**Two-stage methodology**: Our approach combines sophisticated imputation with advanced reweighting techniques. First, we use Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to impute missing variables from multiple data sources, preserving realistic variation and capturing conditional distribution tails. Second, we apply gradient-based optimization with PyTorch to reweight households, matching administrative targets while maintaining the survey's statistical properties.

![Enhanced CPS methodology flowchart showing the two-stage process of imputation and reweighting](/images/posts/enhanced-cps-launch-flowchart.png)

The process flow integrates five source datasets (CPS ASEC, IRS PUF, SIPP, SCF, ACS) that are aged to the target year. Through QRF imputation, we create two enhanced CPS variants: one with missing PUF variables filled in, and another with existing variables replaced by PUF values. These datasets then undergo reweighting optimization to produce the final Enhanced CPS dataset. [View our detailed methodology documentation](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology).

**Microimpute package**: We've developed and adopted [`microimpute`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/microimpute), a new open-source Python package that automates our QRF-based imputation methods. This package makes our imputation methodology more transparent and reusable.

**Advanced reweighting with L0 regularization**: Our reweighting process uses log-transformed weights with dropout regularization and incorporates an L0 penalty for sparsity. This ensures positive weights while preventing overfitting and maintaining interpretability. The optimization minimizes mean squared relative error using the Adam optimizer.

**Enhanced validation**: Our [calibration process](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology#calibration) targets 9,168 administrative totals from sources including IRS SOI, Census, CBO/Treasury, and JCT data, ensuring the Enhanced CPS accurately represents:

- Income components by source
- Benefit program enrollment
- Demographic distributions
- Geographic population counts

## Upcoming developments

### State and local calibration

With support from [Arnold Ventures](https://www.arnoldventures.org/), we're extending the Enhanced CPS to provide accurate estimates for every state and congressional district. This follows our successful implementation of local-area microsimulation in the UK, funded by the [Nuffield Foundation](https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/).

Once complete, the Enhanced CPS will become the default for state-level analysis as well, and PolicyEngine users will be able to analyze the impacts of federal and state policy reforms on:

- Poverty rates by state and congressional district
- Income inequality measures for local areas
- Winners and losers from reforms in specific districts
- Distributional impacts by income decile for each state

### Microcalibrate package

We're developing [`microcalibrate`](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/microcalibrate), a next-generation reweighting package that enhances our current gradient descent approach. This package will offer:

- Faster convergence to calibration targets
- Better preservation of the original survey's covariance structure
- More flexible loss functions for different use cases
- Easier extension to multi-area calibration

### Additional data enhancements

We currently integrate data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (for auto loan interest) and American Community Survey (for housing costs). Future enhancements will expand these integrations:

- **Wealth modeling from SCF**: Comprehensive asset and debt data for modeling asset limits in SNAP, SSI, and other means-tested programs, similar to our [wealth modeling in the UK](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-the-new-policyengine)
- **Consumer Expenditure Survey**: Consumption patterns for modeling sales taxes, carbon pricing, and other consumption-based policies
- **Expanded ACS integration**: Additional geographic and demographic detail for state and local policy analysis

## Using the Enhanced CPS

The Enhanced CPS is now the exclusive dataset for nationwide PolicyEngine US analyses. We've removed the dataset selector to streamline the user experience—the Enhanced CPS automatically powers all federal policy simulations, while state-specific analyses continue to use the standard CPS until our local calibration is complete.

You can access the Enhanced CPS through:

**Web interface**: The Enhanced CPS powers all nationwide calculations at [policyengine.org/us](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us)

**Python package**: Works by default for our `Microsimulation` calls.

**Direct download**: For Python users, the data automatically downloads from our Hugging Face repository when you instantiate a simulation. The files are stored at [`hf://policyengine/policyengine-us-data`](https://huggingface.co/policyengine/policyengine-us-data)

## Technical details

For researchers interested in our methodology:

- **Full technical documentation**: [PolicyEngine US Data documentation](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data)
- **Data integration methodology**: [Imputation and fusion techniques](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology#data-fusion)
- **Calibration approach**: [Reweighting methodology](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/methodology#reweighting)
- **Validation results**: [Comparison with administrative data](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/discussion)
- **Implementation code**: [Microimpute package](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/microimpute)
- **Source code**: [Enhanced CPS on GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us-data/tree/main/policyengine_us_data/datasets/cps)

## Conclusion

The Enhanced CPS represents a major advancement in open-source microsimulation data. By [combining the demographic richness of the Current Population Survey with tax detail from IRS records](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us-data/background) and sophisticated imputation techniques, we've created a dataset that supports comprehensive analysis of both tax and benefit policies.

As we expand to state and local calibration, the Enhanced CPS will enable unprecedented granularity in policy analysis—empowering lawmakers, researchers, and citizens to understand how proposed reforms would affect their communities.

We welcome feedback and collaboration as we continue improving this foundational infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking. For questions or to contribute to development, please visit our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/PolicyEngine) or [contact us](mailto:hello@policyengine.org).

# Analysis of individual income tax provisions in the final reconciliation bill
Slug: final-2025-reconciliation-tax
Date: 2025-07-04
Authors: David Trimmer, Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, policy, featured, reconciliation
Description: Our simulation projects a reduction in federal revenues of $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2035 compared to current law.

---

Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB), after the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119th-congress/senate-amendment/2360) amended and approved it on July 1st. The reconciliation package now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk who is expected to sign the legislation into law. [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1) extends and expands several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), while adding new individual income tax provisions such as deductions for tips and overtime.

Applying the PolicyEngine microsimulation model to most of these provisions, we find that the bill’s individual income tax provisions — compared to current law in which Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025 — would:

- Reduce federal revenues by $3.8 trillion between 2026 and 2035

- Benefit 76% of Americans, while reducing net income for 8% of the population in 2026

- Reduce poverty and deep poverty by 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively in 2026

- Increase the Gini index of inequality by 0.4% in 2026

This report details these results and shows the effects on hypothetical households.

## Income Tax Provisions

While similar to the tax provisions passed by the House of Representatives in May, the final version of the OBBB contains some key differences. In general, the latest bill text makes permanent more tax provisions compared to the bill in May, which implemented temporary boosts throughout the current presidential term. For example, in the bill text from May, the CTC is temporarily boosted to $2,500 before falling to a lower value in 2029. In the latest text, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is increased to $2,200 and then indexed for inflation thereafter. This shift from temporarily enhancing provisions to permanent increases is also found in the standard deduction provision.

The approved bill also places explicit limits on the tips and overtime income exemptions. In the May draft, both provisions were only accessible to those with less than $160,000 of adjusted gross income. In the final bill text, tips are limited to $25,000 per filer, and the overtime exemption has a cap of $12,500 for single filers and $25,000 for married couples. Each limit then phases down at a 10% rate beginning at $150,000 and $300,000 for single and joint filers, respectively.

The bill versions also treat the state and local tax (SALT) deduction differently. Following a compromise between the House SALT Caucus and Republican leadership, the SALT deduction is set to $40,000 and phased down to $10,000 once adjusted gross income reaches $500,000. This structure was permanent in the May bill text, and each parameter would grow by 1 percent over the budget window in perpetuity. In the final bill, this structure is preserved until 2030, when the SALT cap drops to its current policy value of $10,000.

Compared to the House bill, the final bill also:

- Freezes the first two income tax bracket thresholds from 2025 onwards.

- Requires only one parent to have a valid SSN to claim the CTC (rather than both in the May bill text).

- Resets only the inflation adjustment for the phaseout threshold of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and increases the phase-out rate to 50%.

- Limits all itemized deductions at the 35% bracket, rather than having a separate limitation at the 32% bracket for the SALT deduction.

- Sets a qualified business income deduction rate of 20% and creates a minimum deduction of $400 for taxpayers with qualified business income of at least $1,000.

- Increases the senior deduction amount to $6,000 and the phaseout rate to 6%.

- Increases the charitable deduction for non-itemizers to $1,000 and $2,000 for joint filers, while also making the provision permanent.

- Increases the maximum match of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and implements a two-tier phase-down structure.

- Excludes 0.5% of a filer’s adjusted gross income from their deductible charitable contributions.

Each of these discussed provisions and all differences between the versions, for all provisions we model, are summarized in Appendix 1. Let’s examine a few household examples to understand the tax provisions’ effect on specific tax units.

## Household impacts

In 2026, when most provisions are active, households would experience a change in net income dependent on their composition and income sources.

### Elderly couple in Texas

An elderly couple with $80,000 in employment income from Texas would see their [net income rise by $2,835](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54569). While they would benefit from the TCJA extension compared to current law, this couple would also qualify for the additional senior deduction of $12,000 ($6,000 for each elderly member). This paired with the existing additional deduction for senior couples ($3,200) and the extension of the TCJA standard deduction ($32,600 in 2026) prevents this couple from paying any income tax on their first $47,800 of earnings compared to $30,400 under current law.

Figure 1 shows this household’s change in net income over household earnings. Once earnings exceed $30,400, the household begins to see an increase in their net income before plateauing at $47,800. When annual income surpasses $54,500, net income begins to rise again.

### Single undocumented parent in New York

A single parent in New York with two children and $40,000 of earnings would be in line to benefit from the increased CTC compared to current law. However, due to the new SSN requirement for parents under the Senate bill, if they did not have a valid SSN, their net income would [fall by $2,335](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54580) as they would become ineligible for the CTC valued at $1,000 per child under current law. The additional loss of $335 stems from their combined personal exemptions and standard deduction under current law exceeding OBBB’s standard deduction by $3,550. As this makes them face the 10% income bracket, their tax liability increases by $355.

Figure 2 shows that their net income falls at any earnings level between $3,000 and $100,000, and the maximum loss occurs at $45,500 earnings.

### Single adult in Montana with tip income

A single adult from Montana with $50,000 of salaries including $4,000 from tips would [gain $1,903](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54621) from the Senate tax provisions. As the filer’s income falls below the tip income exemption cap, they can fully deduct their $4,000 of tipped income from their federal tax return. In addition to also benefitting from the TCJA extensions, Montana ties its standard deduction to the federal amount by statute, resulting in a lower state tax liability of $731 (included in the total benefit).

Figure 3 shows that the filer’s benefit increases with earnings, for earnings above $8,000.

### High-income couple with two children in California

For a joint filer with two children in California with $1 million of annual income and $60,000 of itemized deductions across several sources, household net income would [drop by $9,627](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) compared to current law. While this filer would benefit from the extensions of the reduced income tax rates, floor exclusion of charitable contributions, and the $40,000 SALT cap all reduce the tax savings the household would be eligible under current law.

In Figure 4, the filer from California benefits from the OBBB seeing its highest increase in net income near $505,000 of earnings. However, at higher earnings levels, the bill limits their itemized deductions, resulting in increasing net losses at earnings levels above $885,000 (including those beyond the $2 million viewable area in Figure 4).

## Microsimulation Results

### Budgetary impact

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that the Senate tax provisions of the One Big Beautiful Big Act would cost $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2035. Additionally, because several proposed changes go into effect this tax year, it would [reduce federal revenues by $63.8 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) in 2025.

**Table 2: Annual Federal Revenue Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB.**

| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|     2026      |                      411.1                       |
|     2027      |                      394.5                       |

### Distributional impact

Our distributional analysis includes the OBBB’s effect on federal taxes, as well as state and local taxes resulting from statutory references to the federal code (e.g., Montana applying the federal standard deduction).

The bill would increase the net income of [76% of U.S. residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) in 2026. The percentage of U.S. residents would vary by income decile, as the highest income decile would have the highest percentage of residents benefiting at 93.5%, while the lowest would have 33.1% of residents see an increase in their net income. Additionally, 7.7% of the U.S. population would be worse off under the tax provisions in 2026. The reduction of net income for residents can be attributed to the SSN requirements for parents to claim the CTC (mostly affecting lower to middle-income households) and limitations on itemized deductions (mostly affecting higher-income tax units).

**Figure 5: Winners and Losers of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*mh1vTI7opHP-XQsL)

In 2026, households in the bottom deciles would gain an average of [$342](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592), while those in the top decile would gain an average of $13,231.

**Figure 6: Average Household Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*19Jo603gE9K6iCTs)

The bill would increase the net income of the top decile by [3.1%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) on average, the largest gain across deciles.

**Figure 7: Average Relative Household Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*wz-eg22GXsF1OdlO)

The OBBB tax provisions would reduce [poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) and [deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps) by 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively. The age group with the largest reduction in poverty would be seniors at 10%, while child poverty would fall by 6.6%, mainly attributable to the increased CTC.

**Figure 8: Poverty Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*cp2U8KbQ9fdfftJB)

In terms of [income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps), the income tax provisions would increase the Gini index by 0.4% in 2026. Furthermore, the bill increases the top 1%’s net income by 1.9%, less than the overall 2.6%, reducing their share of net income would fall by 0.2%.

## Conclusion

The individual income tax reforms as part of HR 1 would cost $3.8 trillion over the 2026–2035 budget window. Considering the state and local effects, we project the bill to benefit 76% of American residents and reduce net income for 8% of the population; the top income decile gains most on an absolute and relative basis. HR 1 would reduce poverty by 5.5% in 2026, while increasing the Gini index of inequality by 0.4%.

\*Indexed for Inflation

[^1]: The May bill text adjusts the year at which the 35% tax bracket is uprated changing it from 2017 to 2016, thereby raising the bracket threshold higher than previously.

[^2]: In 2029, the maximum value of the CTC would drop as the temporary $500 boost expires. However, since the CTC is adjusted for inflation afterwards using 2024 as the base year, the credit’s value would fall to $2,200 rather than $2,000.

# Introducing the OBBBA Household Explorer

Description: New interactive tool reveals household-level impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

---

Following the Senate's July 1st passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), we're launching the [**OBBBA Household Explorer**](../obbba-household-explorer) — an interactive dashboard that shows how this reconciliation bill would affect individual households across America.

[**_Explore Households with our new tool here._**](../obbba-household-explorer)

## What the tool does

The OBBBA Household Explorer allows users to explore the bill’s impacts on over 40,000 representative households from PolicyEngine’s [Enhanced Current Population Survey](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) (CPS) dataset. This dataset integrates and calibrates multiple data sources using machine learning techniques — the same foundation that powers PolicyEngine’s simulations of policy effects on poverty, inequality, and government budgets, when paired with our comprehensive model of federal, state, and local income tax and benefit programs.

The OBBBA extends provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire at the end of 2025, while introducing new elements including:

- Tax exemptions for tip and overtime income

- Modifications to the Child Tax Credit

- Changes to the SALT deduction cap

- Cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits

By capturing these and more as of 2026, we show the breadth of the bills’ impacts on households that collectively represent the nation.

## Examples

To illustrate the tool’s capabilities, let’s explore two households. While both are couples around 60 years old, varying attributes and analysis configurations shows how results vary.

### Couple in Montana, Senate bill against current law

First consider household **#66994**, a couple in Montana, ages 53 and 61, with $214,850 income.

![Screenshot of OBBBA Household Explorer interface showing household selection screen with filters set to Random Shuffle method and household #66994 selected](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*femrvCx4TOJ3ea_3)

Comparing the Senate bill to current law, they would gain $13,577, paying $11,831 less in federal tax and $1,746 less in state tax.

![Financial impact breakdown table showing: Market Income $214,850, Federal Taxes -$11,831 (-24.5%), State Taxes -$1,746 (-16.0%), Benefits $0 (0.0%), Net Income $13,577 (+4.8%)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*_xZhF7_TUE_RT5Eh)

That $13,577 gain results from reforms to the tax brackets, standard deduction, qualified business income deduction, and overtime income exemption, less a $2,332 loss from the repeal of exemptions.

![Waterfall chart titled "Impact of Senate OBBBA Against Current Law by Provision on Net Income" showing baseline net income of $118,311, increases from tax rate reform ($4,754), standard deduction reform ($4,515), QBID reform ($3,125), overtime income exempt ($3,514), offset by exemption reform (-$2,332), resulting in final net income of $131,888](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*42RcvRHuC_8TJdD2)

We can also select state taxes to explore the $1,746 gain, finding that it results from the standard deduction reform. Beginning in 2024, Montana adopted the federal standard deduction by statute. PolicyEngine's [TAXSIM](http://taxsim.nber.org)-validated tax model captures these interactions between federal and state policy.

![Waterfall chart titled "Impact of Senate OBBBA Against Current Law by Provision on State Taxes" showing baseline state taxes of $10,620, with a $1,746 reduction from standard deduction reform, resulting in final state taxes of $8,874](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*PmdWaNAceYNyVgMW)

### Couple in Georgia, House bill against current policy

Next let's consider household **#43826**, a Georgia couple with $71,820 income.

![Screenshot of OBBBA Household Explorer interface showing household attributes for Georgia couple, including state GA, household size 2, marital status married, and market income $71,820](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*0tcLOTIau2vDApZe)

This household would pay $1,023 less in federal tax, while losing $1,971 in benefits, for a net loss of $947.

![Financial impact breakdown table showing: Baseline Value $71,820, Absolute Change -$947, % Change -1.4%, with details showing Market Income $71,820, Federal Taxes -$1,023 (-24.5%), State Taxes $0 (-10.0%), Benefits -$1,971 (-18.0%), Net Income -$947 (-1.4%)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*038Eb7mHdWpDA3Kg)

Like the Montana couple, this couple benefits from the standard deduction reform and overtime exemption.

![Waterfall chart titled "Impact of House OBBBA Against Current Policy by Provision on Federal Taxes" showing baseline federal taxes of $4,176, with reductions from standard deduction reform ($521) and overtime income exempt ($502), resulting in final federal taxes of $3,153](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*y8DvE7OXLVAZvd7R)

However, they lose $1,971 in Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, whose enhancements (which are part of current policy) expire at the end of 2025.

![Waterfall chart titled "Impact of House OBBBA Against Current Policy by Provision on Benefits" showing baseline benefits of $7,981, with a $1,971 reduction from ACA Enhanced Subsidies Reform, resulting in final benefits of $6,010](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*QZQGbe-JhdRw7ifM)

PolicyEngine counts premium tax credits as benefits since they are subsidized premiums throughout the year. Our rules engine calculates these credits to the dollar. Additionally, our rules engine calculates the dollar impacts of households modeled to lose SNAP and Medicaid access, per projections from the Congressional Budget Office.

## Key features

To go beyond these examples (and household **#118944** for this report’s cover image), you can leverage the tool’s full set of features.

### 🎲 Quick exploration

The **Get Random Household** button lets you instantly explore impacts across America’s diverse population. Each click reveals a different household, weighted by population representation — allowing rapid exploration of how impacts vary by circumstance.

### 📊 Comprehensive analysis

The tool analyzes impacts on:

- **Federal taxes**: Changes from tax rate adjustments, deductions, and credits

- **State taxes**: How federal changes affect state income tax liability

- **Benefits**: Changes to programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies

- **Net income**: Combined effect on take-home pay

### 🔍 Detailed filtering

Find households similar to your situation by:

- State

- Income level

Description: The Child Tax Credit expansion would cost the federal government $2.5 trillion over ten years and lower child poverty by 25%.

---

On April 9th, a group of Democratic Senators and House members [reintroduced the American Family Act](https://www.bennet.senate.gov/2025/04/09/bennet-booker-warnock-cortez-masto-durbin-wyden-senate-colleagues-reintroduce-the-american-family-act-to-expand-the-child-tax-credit/) (AFA). [The bill](https://www.bennet.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/American-Family-Act-2025.pdf#page=8), similar to previous versions of the AFA and Kamala Harris’s Child Tax Credit (CTC) proposal during the 2024 presidential election, would expand the credit’s size and reach for tax year 2025 and beyond.

We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect the American Family Act’s proposed changes and analyzed its effect on the United States and its residents.

Key results (static):

- Costs $2.5 trillion from 2025 to 2034

- Benefits 42% of Americans in 2025 and 47% in 2026

- Lowers the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 11.4% and child poverty by 25.2%

- Reduces the Gini index of income inequality by 2.4%

## History of Democrats’ Push to Expand the CTC

In the past decade, Democratic lawmakers have supported several proposals to expand the Child Tax Credit. Senator Michael Bennet [released his first iteration](https://www.bennet.senate.gov/2017/10/26/press-releases-id-143425d3-e065-d861-babf-1b9c90cebf54/) of the American Family Act in 2017, which would make the CTC fully refundable and increase the credit to $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for kids 6 to 17. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which included the AFA for the 2021 tax year only. Senator Michael Bennet, alongside Rep. Rosa DeLauro in the House of Representatives, [reintroduced the AFA in 2023](https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fact-sheet-american-family-act-of-2023.pdf), with similar parameters passed in ARPA. During her presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris introduced a CTC proposal that mirrored the ARPA expansion while including a baby bonus provision that increases the credit amount for families with newborns. Neither the 2023 AFA nor Kamala Harris’ proposal was implemented, leaving the CTC at its current maximum of $2,000 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In 2026, the CTC is scheduled to revert to its pre-TCJA value of $1,000.

## The American Family Act’s Provisions

The 2025 American Family Act makes several changes to the Child Tax Credit (CTC). While the 2025 AFA shares a structure with previous versions and [Harris’s CTC plan](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-ctc) and the [American Rescue Plan Act CTC](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expanded-child-tax-credit), it offers larger benefits than these other CTC proposals.

Under the 2025 AFA, children under the age of six are eligible for a maximum credit of $4,320 ($360 per month), while children aged 6 to 17 would receive $3,600 ($300 per month). The 2025 AFA also contains a baby bonus where parents of newborns can claim $2,400 for the first month instead of the standard $360 monthly credit for young children. This means families with newborn children would receive a total of $6,360 during the baby’s first year. Additionally, the 2025 AFA extends the $500 nonrefundable adult dependent credit beyond its scheduled 2026 expiration date, preserving a benefit that was originally enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Like the previous proposals, the 2025 AFA implements a phase-out structure with two tiers. The CTC would initially begin to decrease at $112,500 adjusted gross income ($150,000 joint). At this level, the credit’s value drops by $50 for each $1,000 of income above the threshold until reaching $2,000 for each child claimed. At $300,000 AGI ($400,000 joint), the CTC would continue to decrease at the same rate until it reaches zero. The adult dependent credit only begins its phase-out at the second threshold, where it also reduces by $50 for each $1,000 over the limit. Under the AFA, the adult dependent credit phases out simultaneously with the CTC, unlike under the TCJA, where the CTC and the adult dependent credit values are combined and then phased out. Lastly, the American Family Act eliminates the TCJA provision that requires children to have a valid Social Security Number to receive the credit; under the AFA, children with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) would now be eligible.

Table 1 summarizes the key parameters of the 2025 AFA compared against the previous version of the bill and Kamala Harris’s CTC proposal.

## Household Impacts

Since the 2025 AFA makes the CTC fully refundable, households with no household earnings would now be eligible for the entire credit, raising their net income. For example, a single parent with a newborn and no income currently receives no CTC. However, with the fully refundable CTC and baby bonus component, their [net income would increase by $6,360](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2028&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53124), the highest gain of any household with one child.

Middle-income families with qualifying children will also see a boost to their net income. For example, a married couple with two children (ages 4 and 8) with $80,000 of annual earnings [would gain $3,920](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2028&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53129). Their new CTC allotment would reach $7,920, increasing from $4,000 today.

As income rises, households will be subject to the initial phase-out. A single parent with one older child and $135,000 of earnings will receive $2,450 from the CTC, [resulting in a gain of $450 to their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2028&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53141). As this household’s income exceeds the lower threshold of $112,500 for head of household filers, the CTC value is reduced, falling by $1,150 from its $3,600 maximum. If this family’s income fell between $150,000 and $300,000, they would receive $2,000 as the initial threshold cannot reduce the benefit lower than $2,000 per child.

However, because the current CTC begins to fully phase out at $200,000 for head of household filers, this household with $250,000 of annual earnings would see a [$2,000 increase to their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2028&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53143) as the AFA raises the higher phaseout threshold to $300,000. Once household income reaches $340,000, the CTC fully phases out, and their change in net income falls back to $0.

The AFA leaves some married filers with both adult and child dependents worse off: consider a couple with earnings of $425,000, an adult dependent, and an 8-year-old child. As the AFA phases out — the adult dependent credit and CTC simultaneously — joint filers see a decrease in net income until the entirety of the CTC and adult dependent credit value phases out, as under current law. For this household, net income begins to fall at $400,000 before plateauing at [a $500 decrease](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2028&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54174). Once the current CTC is phased out at $440,000, net income begins to rise as the remaining $500 adult dependent credit begins to phase out. At $450,000, net income stabilizes at $0. The AFA’s increased head of household phase-out threshold prevents unmarried filers from paying higher tax.

Figure 1 displays the value of the CTC under the AFA compared to current law, while Figure 2 shows the change in net income for a single parent with one older child as annual earnings vary.

## Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that the American Family Act will cost the federal government [$167.2 billion in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps). Over a ten-year period (2025–2034), the legislation will reduce federal tax revenues by $2.5 trillion.

**Table 3: Annual Federal Budgetary Impact of the AFA**

|     2025      |                       167.2                        |
|     2026      |                       230.0                        |

|     2028      |                       249.3                        |
|     2029      |                       249.0                        |
|     2030      |                       258.7                        |
|     2031      |                       268.0                        |
|     2032      |                       267.7                        |
|     2033      |                       277.0                        |
|     2034      |                       286.7                        |
| **2025-2034** |                    **2,493.1**                     |

Because the TCJA’s CTC provisions expire for tax year 2026, the cost of the AFA increases as the CTC’s value is projected to fall to $1,000 compared to its current maximum of $2,000. In addition to the federal budgetary impact, the AFA will reduce state revenues by $35 billion over ten years due to interactions with the CTC provisions.

The AFA will [raise the net income of 42.1% of American residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps) in 2025, including 25% of those in the top income decile and 54% of those in the fifth decile. Additionally, 1.7% of people in the top income decile would see their net incomes decline due to the adult dependent phasing out independently of the CTC rather than as one combined value. In 2026, when the TCJA expires, the AFA will increase the net income of [46.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps) of people, while leaving no households worse off, since the adult dependent credit expires with the TCJA.

**Figure 2: Winners of the AFA (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*WD5Kayp8qBK35MiO)

The AFA is projected to provide an average benefit of [$1,115 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps). Families in the fifth decile would see the highest average benefit at $1,491, while the top decile would see the lowest gain of $524, due to the credit phaseouts. When examining average benefit by percent of net income, the [first decile receives the largest gain](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps), then decreases by each subsequent decile. In 2026, the average household benefit [increases to $1,540](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps).

**Figure 3: Average Benefit of the AFA by Decile (2025 and 2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ge7UUoqD7bSVBD-M)

The child tax credit expansion would [reduce poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps) (as defined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) by 11.4% and child poverty by 25.2% in 2025. Deep poverty and deep child poverty would [fall by 12.2% and 29.9%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps), respectively. These poverty statistics vary by less than six percentage points across years in the 10-year budget window.

**Figure 4: Poverty Reduction Under the AFA (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Pp-AjRIDH8FppVqL)

Finally, the AFA will reduce the United States’ Gini index of inequality [by 2.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps). The bill would also reduce the top 10% and 1%’s share of net income by 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively. In 2026, the Gini index is [projected to fall by 2.8%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=82820&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps).

## Conclusion

The American Family Act will expand the Child Tax Credit by making the credit fully refundable and increasing its size for each eligible child. Over the next ten years, the AFA will reduce federal revenues by $2.5 trillion, assuming no behavioral responses. The proposed legislation will benefit 42% of the population in 2025 and provide an average benefit of $1,115 per household, varying by income decile. The AFA is projected to reduce child poverty by 25% and deep child poverty by 30% in 2025. Beginning in 2026, TCJA’s expiration results in a higher counterfactual cost and impact (poverty, inequality, and population share affected) than in 2025.

# Manager's Amendment to H.R.1 - The One Big Beautiful Bill Act
Slug: managers-amendment-to-hr1
Date: 2025-05-24
Authors: Pavel Makarchuk, David Trimmer, Max Ghenis
Tags: us, policy, featured, reconciliation
Description: We project that individual provisions in the manager's amendment will cost $22 billion over the budget window.

---

Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted 215–214 to approve [H.R.1 — One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1) (OBBBA). The bill extends and enhances several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), while adding new individual income tax provisions such as exemptions for tip and overtime income and a deduction for auto loan interest.

Included in the passed bill by the Rules Committee is a ["Manager's Amendment,"](https://punchbowl.news/wp-content/uploads/managers-amendment.pdf) which revises three tax provisions in the [Budget Committee's version](https://budget.house.gov/imo/media/doc/one_big_beautiful_bill_act_-_full_bill_text.pdf) of the OBBBA.

These reforms include:

1. Increasing the cap on state and local tax deductions (the SALT cap)

1. Reducing the exemption and phase-out start for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) by changing its indexing year

1. Further limiting itemized deductions for high-income filers

In this report, we demonstrate the impact of the manager's amendment through hypothetical households and simulate its net effects on the U.S. against a baseline of the Budget Committee's OBBBA. We find that the changes will:

- Decrease revenues by $22.0 billion from 2026 to 2035

- Raise net income for 3.1% of Americans in 2026, while reducing net income for 3.3%

- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.15%

_View the impact of the Manager's Amendment on [the economy](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps) and [your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps)._

## Manager's Amendment Provisions

The Ways and Means Committee introduced the [initial OBBBA tax provisions](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SMITMO_017_xml.pdf) on May 12th. That bill extended TCJA provisions like lower rates, a higher standard deduction, and an expanded Child Tax Credit (except for a new Social Security Number requirement), while introducing new provisions such as exemptions for tip and overtime income. It also revised three TCJA policies: the SALT cap, the AMT, and the limitation on itemized deductions.

The manager's amendment further revised these policies, while also revising other policies such as Medicaid work requirements and Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

In sum, the manager's amendment:

1. **Expanded the SALT deduction** between the [Ways and Means SALT cap](https://policyengine.org/us/research/ways-and-means-salt-cap) and the [SALT Caucus's proposed SALT cap](https://policyengine.org/us/research/salt-caucus-62k-cap)

1. **Reduced the AMT exemption amount and exemption phase-out start** by changing the base year from 2017 to 2025 for inflation indexing

1. **Further limits itemized deductions** by effectively treating the SALT deduction as if the filer is in the 32% bracket, for those in the top (37%) bracket

## Comparison of Discussed SALT Caps

Under current law, the state and local tax deduction is set to become uncapped starting in 2026 after being limited to $10,000 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The initial draft of the OBBBA capped the SALT deduction at $30,000, and once adjusted gross income reaches $400,000, the limitation phases down at a 20% rate until reaching $10,000 (the maximum, floor, and phase-out threshold are all halved for married couples filing separately).[^1]

[^1]: The Ways and Means bill also includes provisions that are meant to limit workarounds that states have implemented to avoid the SALT cap. We did not model these provisions in this analysis.

Under the new compromise, households could claim up to $40,000 in SALT ($20,000 for separate filers) in 2025. Unlike the Ways and Means bill, the new SALT increase would start in 2025 rather than 2026, thus increasing the current cap of $10,000 this year. The deduction phases out at a 30% rate for filers with adjusted gross income above $500,000. The SALT cap and phase-out threshold grow by 1% each year until 2033, at which point the values would remain constant. Figure 1 displays the different SALT caps for single filers under the initial bill and the amended version.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*WWW4GvxooQQxEr1-)

In addition to these changes, the manager's amendment increased the overall limitation on itemized deductions to 5/37 of the lesser of a household's total SALT deduction or the difference between their taxable income and the top income bracket's threshold. The 2/37 limitation remains for all other itemized deductions. Furthermore, the manager's amendment sets 2025 as the base year for alternative minimum tax inflation adjustments, lowering the AMT exemption amount and phase-out start. Each change will affect a household's eligible SALT deduction and [effective SALT cap](https://policyengine.org/us/research/introducing-salternative).

## Household Impacts

The changes to the SALT deduction, overall limitation on itemized deductions, and AMT would affect households that itemize their deductions and have state and local tax expenses greater than the initial limit in the Ways and Means bill. To understand this, let's examine a single adult in Texas making $500,000, with $40,000 in property taxes[^2] and $50,000 in other itemized deductions (e.g., charitable contributions or mortgage interest). Under the manager's amendment, they would see an [increase in their net income of $10,640](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53694) in 2026, compared to the Ways and Means OBBBA. Figure 2 displays how this filer's net income would change as their household earnings vary.

[^2]: While Texas lacks a state income tax, filers can also deduct their sales tax, either reported or estimated from IRS tables. PolicyEngine calculates state sales tax from these tables, which adds between $634 and $2,677 to this filer's SALT. Combined with the $40,000 property taxes, they will exceed the $40,400 SALT cap for 2026 at all income levels.

**Figure 2: Effect of OBBBA Manager's Amendment on Net Income for a Single Filer with $40k in Property Taxes and $50k in Other Deductions (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*WSC2Y1Dt0V6CV9by)

Let's dissect this segment by segment, starting at $90,000 earnings where the amendment begins to increase their net income (lower their taxes). As shown in Figure 3, this results from a $10,400 larger SALT deduction.

**Figure 3: Effect of OBBBA Manager's Amendment on SALT Deduction for a Single Filer with $40k in Property Taxes and $50k in Other Deductions (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2728/1*eMqhfEzfaTXNCgsN8fF02w.png)

At $155,000 earnings, their net income begins to decrease, and then after the change reaches its lowest point at $277,500 earnings, it begins rising again. Figure 4 shows that these result from being subjected to AMT due to the smaller AMT exemption, and then the AMT effect phasing out.

**Figure 4: Effect of OBBBA Manager's Amendment on AMT for a Single Filer with $40k in Property Taxes and $50k in other deductions (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2632/1*dcAgTGnGsc6GmoTyuUCANg.png)

At $400,000 earnings, the filer's SALT deduction rises as the previous version began phasing out at that threshold, while the manager amendment pushed the phaseout to $505,000 in 2026. Once the household's SALT deduction begins to phase out, net income falls until reaching $0 at $606,000 of earnings. At $645,000, change in net income falls below zero due to the overall limitation on itemized deductions. Figure 5 shows these in the context of total itemized deductions.

**Figure 5: Effect of OBBBA Manager's Amendment on Itemized Deductions for a Single Filer with $50k in Other Deductions (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2680/1*5sTi9ZNwmXQ_D-1oSNajdQ.png)

The amendment would affect the single adult's marginal tax rates (MTRs) at various earnings levels, as shown in Figure 3. Because the SALT cap no longer phases out at the $400,000 income level, the filer's MTR falls by 7 percentage points between $400,000 and $497,500. It then rises by 10.5 percentage points for earnings between $505,000 and $605,000. Finally, the SALT limitation increases MTRs by 4.7 percentage points and then lowers it at income levels where the previous would have taken effect.

**Figure 6: Change in Marginal Tax Rates Based on Household Earnings for a Single Filer with $40,000+ in SALT and $50,000 in Other Deductions (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*49qYWPaLw8XHY9z0)

Due to the increase of the later SALT cap phase-out threshold, the total MTR increases to 47.9% for earnings between $562,000 to $605,000, its highest level above benefit phase-out income ranges.

**Figure 7: Marginal Tax Rates for Single Filer Under the pre- and post-manager's Amendment OBBBA (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3180/0*PYEnclmxwDy_LScu)

In jurisdictions with state and local income taxes, the SALT cap phase-out results in higher MTRs. For example, Figure 8 shows that this same filer would face a 59.8% MTR in California when earning between $522,500 and $605,000.

**Figure 8: Marginal Tax Rates of a Single Filer in California Under the pre- and post-manager's Amendment OBBBA (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*kife4O3RHxgdiExI)

The highest MTR we identified as a result of the amendment occurs in New York City, where the filer would face a 63.1% rate on earnings between $505,000 and $522,500 (see Figure 9).

Filers with different income levels and amounts of itemized deductions would experience varying changes to their net income. Table 2 shows the change in net income for several household examples in Texas.

**Table 2: Change in Net Income for Various Single Adults in Texas Based on Itemized Deductions and Household Earnings**

| Property tax | Other itemized deductions | $100k  | $250k | $500k   | $1M   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| $0           | $0                        | $0     | $0    | $0      | $0    |
| $20k         | $0                        | $0     | $0    | $2,472  | $0    |
| $40k         | $0                        | $2,288 | $503  | $8,488  | $0    |
| $0           | $50k                      | $0     | $0    | $0      | -$96  |
| $20k         | $50k                      | $0     | $0    | $4,624  | -$300 |
| $40k         | $50k                      | $1,197 | -$193 | $10,640 | -$300 |

Filers in other situations, such as with high capital gains, could face larger impacts from the amendment due to the alternative minimum tax. We do not illustrate hypothetical households with these characteristics, but include them in our microsimulation analysis.

## Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine's static microsimulation model, we project that the manager's amendment to the One Big Beautiful Big Act would [increase the cost of the tax package by $22.0 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps) over the next ten years (2026–2035).[^3] Additionally, because the proposed changes go into effect in 2025, it would [increase federal revenues by $3.0 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps) this year.

[^3]: We project that state tax revenues would increase by $0.2bn over the budget window (2026-2035).

| **2026-2035** | **-22.0**                                        |

The SALT cap would [increase the net income of 3.1% of US residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps) in 2026 and decrease it for 3.3% of the population. Of individuals in the top income decile, 30% would experience a reduction in net income and 9% would experience a gain.

Households in the top decile see their tax liability fall by [$347 on average](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps). The second income decile would see an average gain of $218 in 2026, potentially due to some high income filers in households with low- or negative-income filers.

When it comes to inequality, the SALT Caucus proposal would, in 2026, [lower the Gini index](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=85113&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=85188&dataset=enhanced_cps) by 0.15%, and lower the top 1%'s share of net income by 0.03%

## Conclusion

The Manager's Amendment to H.R.1 — The One Big Beautiful Bill Act modifies three tax provisions originally outlined in the Budget Committee's version:

1. Expands the SALT cap from $30,000 to $40,400 in 2026

1. Reduces the alternative minimum tax exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds by changing the base year to 2025

1. Implements a higher limitation on the SALT deductions than other itemized expenses for high-income filers.

These changes would reduce federal revenues by $22.0 billion over the ten-year window when utilizing static modeling. In 2026, 3.1% of Americans would experience an increased net income and while 3.3% see their after-tax income reduce. Additionally, the Gini index of income inequality would fall by 0.15% and while the top 1%'s share of net income decreases by 0.03%.

# Montana Reduces Top Income Tax Rate and Expands EITC
Slug: montana-tax-cuts-2026
Date: 2025-05-22
Authors: David Trimmer

Description: Montana's latest individual income tax changes will lower state revenues by $245 million and raise net income for an estimated 77% of residents in 2027.

---

[On April 28, 2025](https://news.mt.gov/Governors-Office/Governor_Gianforte_Celebrates_Largest_Income_Tax_Cut_in_State-_History#:~:text=House%20Bill%20337%20lowers%20the,tax%20credit%20for%20hardworking%20Montanans.), Governor Greg Gianforte (R-MT) [signed House Bill 337](https://bills.legmt.gov/#/laws/bill/2/LC1716?open_tab=bill), a bill that amends Montana's individual income tax code. HB337 reduces the state's top income tax rate from 5.9% to 5.65% in 2026 and further to 5.4% in 2027. It also raises the income threshold for the lower tax bracket for all filing statuses over two years. Additionally, the bill increases the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from 10% to 20% of the federal EITC, beginning in 2026.

We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect these changes and analyzed their effects on the state of Montana and its residents.

Key results in 2027:

- Costs the state $245 million

- Benefits 77% of Montana residents

- Lowers the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 0.8% and child poverty by 3.2%

- Raises the Gini index of income inequality by 0.16%

## Montana's Recent Income Tax Reforms

Montana has reformed its individual income tax policy in a series of bills beginning in 2021:

1. [Senate Bill 159 (2021)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/SB0159.pdf) lowered the state's top marginal rate from 6.9% to 6.75% beginning with tax year 2022, but left the seven-bracket structure intact.

1. [Senate Bill 399 (2021)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/SB0399.pdf) collapsed those seven brackets into two: 4.7% on the first $20,500 of Montana taxable income ($41,000 for joint filers) and 6.5% above that. It also tied the state tax base to federal taxable income instead of creating its own taxable income concept based on federal adjusted gross income, repealing some state-specific deductions.

1. [Senate Bill 121(2023)](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2023/BillPdf/SB0121.pdf) lowered the top rate to 5.9%, effective tax year 2024, and increased the state's EITC match from 3% to 10%.

## House Bill 337's Tax Provisions

The reforms passed in House Bill 337 will continue to lower the tax liability for most Montana residents. As shown in Table 1, the bill lowers the state's top income tax rate to 5.65% in 2026 and 5.4% in 2027. The bill also raises the lower bracket thresholds over two years and doubles Montana's EITC from 10% to a 20% match of the federal credit.

| Parameter               | Filing Status            | 2026 (pre-HB377) | 2026 (post-HB377) | 2027 (pre-HB377) | 2027 (post-HB377) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Top Income Tax Rate     | All                      | 5.9%             | 5.65%             | 5.9%             | 5.4%              |
| Lower Bracket Threshold | Head of household        | $31,800          | $72,500           | $32,500          | $97,500           |
| Lower Bracket Threshold | Single & Separate        | $21,200          | $47,500           | $21,700          | $65,000           |
| Lower Bracket Threshold | Joint & Surviving Spouse | $42,300          | $95,000           | $43,300          | $130,000          |
| EITC Match              | All                      | 10%              | 20%               | 10%              | 20%               |

## Household Impacts

As the tax package comprises several components, different household compositions will see varying impacts to their net income. Let's examine a few examples.

For a single adult with no children and $10,000 of earnings, the tax provisions increase their net income [by $69 in 2026](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53241) and [$68 in 2027](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53566), solely from the doubled EITC match.

A single parent of two kids with an annual income of $50,000 will see a [$252 increase to their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53576) due to House Bill 337: $179 from the expanded EITC, and $73 from the lower bracket threshold. In 2027, their net income [rises by $266](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53577), with $205 from the EITC and $61 in reduced state income taxes. Figures 1 and 2 show the change in net income for this household as earnings rise for 2026 and 2027, respectively.

A married couple with no dependents and $200,000 of earnings will see the largest change in net income of the examined households. As their income exceeds the eligible range for the EITC, they only benefit from the reduction of Montana's top income tax rate and the expansion of the lower tax bracket thresholds. In 2026, their [tax savings total $853](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53586); in 2027, their [liability drops by $1,306](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949&household=53590).

**Table 2: Change in Net Income Based on Household Composition**

| Household Composition          | 2026 Net Income Change | 2027 Net Income Change |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Single, No Children, $10,000   | $66                    | $68                    |
| Single, Two Children, $50,000  | $252                   | $266                   |

A single parent with two kids initially sees an increase in their net income solely from the increased EITC. Once the credit reaches the plateau, the family's net income is raised by $730 in 2026 and $746 in 2027. Once the credit phases down, their net income falls. After the EITC is fully phased out, the household benefits only from the income tax bracket and rate changes, lowering their net income further as earnings grow.

## Statewide Impacts 2026

For tax year 2026, Montana's latest income tax changes will [reduce state revenues by $167.7 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949), according to PolicyEngine's static modeling based on the Current Population Survey.

The tax changes will [raise the net income of 75.9% of residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949) in Montana. The percentage of residents in each income decile who are net beneficiaries will vary. For example, 14% of residents in the lowest income decile will see their net income increase, while all residents in the top two deciles will see a gain.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*39scSjSHATzhlt02bLACmA.png)

Montana's new tax package will provide an [average benefit of $318 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949) in 2026, ranging from $16 in the bottom income decile to $1,033 in the top decile (as defined by the nationwide income distribution).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*PQrfC3BSFz3B0HO_ElrHRg.png)

We project the tax changes to [reduce poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949) (using the Supplemental Poverty Measure) by 0.4%, while lowering child poverty by 1.9%. The individual income tax reforms will have [no impact on deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949).

The state's Gini index of inequality [will increase by 0.05%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949), while the top 1%'s share of total net income will fall by 0.06%

## Statewide Impacts for 2027

In 2027, Montana's income tax changes as part of House Bill 337 will [lower the state's revenues by $244.7 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949), using static modeling.

Additionally, 76.7% of Montana residents will see [an increase in their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949). As in 2026, the percentage of residents who are better off under the reform will vary by income decile. In the lowest decile, 14% of residents are net beneficiaries, while 100% of Montanans in the three highest deciles will see their net incomes rise.

**Figure 5: Winners of Montana's Income Tax Package by Decile for 2027**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*B-YVYsZ5cacRqn4dOcK6Mg.png)

House Bill 337's provisions are projected to provide an average benefit of [$456 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949) in 2027. This will range from $17 in the bottom income decile to $1,784 in the tenth decile.

**Figure 6: Average Benefit of Montana's Income Tax Changes by Decile for 2027**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_axBsS8FXEeqVD6_nc_8pQ.png)

Montana's individual income tax changes will have the following effects on poverty and inequality in 2027:

- [Lower the SPM](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949) by 0.8% and child poverty by 3.2%,

- Have [no effect](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949&household=53576) on deep poverty,

- Raise the Gini index of inequality [by 0.16%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949), and the top 1%'s share of net income by 0.05%

## Conclusion

Montana's individual tax reforms, as part of House Bill 337, will lower the state's top marginal tax rate, increase the income thresholds for the bottom bracket, and double the state's match to the federal EITC. The budgetary effect of these reforms will lower state revenues by $168 million in 2026 and $245 million in 2027. Between 76% and 77% of residents will benefit each year, with the average household benefit totaling $318 in 2026, before increasing to $456 in 2027. The net benefits will vary based on family income, but households in the top decile will receive the largest average absolute gain in [2026](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2026&baseline=82949) and [2027](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=mt&timePeriod=2027&baseline=82949). When all provisions are active in 2027, poverty in the state will fall by 0.8% while income inequality will rise by 0.16%, as measured by the Gini index.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

# The SALT Caucus's Proposed Cap
Slug: salt-caucus-62k-cap
Date: 2025-05-15
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, featured, reconciliation
Description: We project that replacing the SALT cap approved by the Ways and Means Committee with the SALT Caucus proposal would cost $497 billion over the budget window.

---

[In our previous report](https://policyengine.org/us/research/ways-and-means-salt-cap), we simulated the SALT cap set in “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” which phases down a $30,000 cap to $10,000 for filers with income above $400,000. While the Ways and Means Committee approved the bill yesterday, [The Hill reports](https://thehill.com/business/5295825-salt-deduction-cap-increase-debate/) that SALT Caucus members have pushed to raise the cap to $62,000 ($124,000 for married filers), adjusted for inflation, unlike the bill.

Utilizing our baseline of the tax reforms in the Ways and Means bill (see Appendix A), we analyze how the SALT Caucus’s proposal would affect American households and the U.S. economy.

Key results (static):

- Increases the cost of the tax bill by $497 billion from 2026 to 2035

- Raises net income for 3.7% of Americans in 2026

- Lowers the Supplemental Poverty Measure by less than 0.001%

- Increases the Gini index of income inequality by 0.2%

_Use PolicyEngine to [view the full results](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) or calculate the [effect on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps)._

## Comparison of SALT Caps

Under current law, the state and local tax deduction is set to become uncapped starting in 2026 after being limited to $10,000 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Under the BBB, the SALT deduction would be capped at $30,000, and once adjusted gross income reaches $400,000, the limitation phases down at a 20% rate until reaching $10,000 (the maximum, floor, and phase-out threshold are all halved for married filing separately filers).[^1]

[^1]: The Ways and Means bill also includes provisions that are meant to limit workarounds that states have implemented to avoid the SALT cap. We did not model these provisions in this analysis.

Under the SALT Caucus’s preferred limit, single filers could claim up to $62,000 in SALT, while the limit for married couples would be $124,000. Unlike the Ways and Means bill, the SALT Caucus’s cap would be implemented in 2025 rather than 2026, would not phase down for higher-income households, and the limits would be adjusted for inflation.[^2] Figure 1 displays the different SALT limits for single filers under both SALT caps.

[^2]: As there is no reported details regarding the inflation adjustments, we rounded to the nearest dollar for all thresholds following tax year 2025. In 2026, the SALT Caucus caps would be uprated to $62,948 for single filers and $125,896 for married couples.

## Household Impacts

As we are only comparing between the BBB SALT cap and the one preferred by the SALT Caucus, only households that itemize their deductions and have state and local tax expenses greater than the Ways and Means limit would be affected. Let’s examine a similar household to the one we covered in the previous analysis: a single adult in New York making $500,000, but with $70,000 in property taxes (instead of $45,000). Under the BBB SALT cap, they would see a [reduction in their net income of $28,391](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53440) in 2026, compared to if the SALT deduction became uncapped as it is scheduled to under current law. However, under the SALT Caucus proposal, their net income would [fall by $12,012](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53440), representing a [$16,379 gain](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53440) when compared to the $30,000 SALT cap approved by the Ways and Means Committee. Figure 2 displays how the single adult’s net income would change as their household earnings vary if the approved SALT cap were replaced with the SALT Caucus proposal.

**Figure 2: Effect of Replacing the SALT Cap on Net Income Based on Household Earnings for a Single Filer with $62,948+ in SALT (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*QMQEu4uN0tpKKYVk)

Replacing the cap would affect the single adult’s marginal tax rates (MTRs) at various earnings levels, as shown in Figure 3. Because the SALT Caucus cap does not include a phase-out, the filer’s MTR is reduced by 7 percentage points between $400,000 and $470,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*-SNOfJRH5ViUgJug)

Due to the removal of the SALT cap phase-out, the total marginal tax rate falls from 51.2% to 44.2% for earnings between $400,000 to $470,000.

## Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that replacing the $30,000 SALT cap with the SALT Caucus proposal would [increase the cost of the tax package by $496.8 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) over the next ten years (2026–2035).[^3] Additionally, because the SALT Caucus proposal goes into effect in 2025, it would [lower federal revenues by $43.3 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) that year since it raises the current $10,000 cap.

[^3]: We project that state tax revenues would decrease by $2.9 billion over the budget window (2026-2035).

| Year          | Federal Revenue Impact in billions of $ (Static) |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026          | -37.2                                            |
| 2027          | -38.8                                            |

| 2030          | -47.3                                            |
| 2031          | -50.1                                            |
| 2032          | -53.7                                            |
| 2033          | -57.3                                            |
| 2034          | -61.4                                            |

| **2026-2035** | **-496.8**                                       |

The SALT cap would [increase the net income of 3.7% of US residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) in 2026, including 26% of residents in the top decile and 1.2% of those in the bottom nine deciles.

**Figure 6: Winners of the Replacing the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*myyx97sW6kZ2KS2l)

Households in the top decile see their tax liability fall by [$2,621 on average](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps). The bottom four deciles would see an average gain of $3 or less.

**Figure 6: Average Impact of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*IBfKPm1J0NOaJl_t)

When it comes to poverty and inequality, the SALT Caucus proposal would, in 2026:

- [Lower poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) (as defined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) by 0.00006%,

- Reduce deep poverty [by 0.0002%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps),

- [Raise the Gini index of inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) by 0.2%, and the top 1%’s share of net income by 3.0%

## Conclusion

Conditional on other provisions in the BBB, we find that implementing the SALT Caucus’s preferred limits of $62,000 and $124,000, compared to the $30,000 cap approved by the committee, would increase the cost of the bill by $497 billion over ten years, assuming no behavioral responses. The new limitation would increase the after-tax incomes of 3.7% of the population in 2026, with households in the top income decile experiencing the largest gains on an [absolute](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) and [relative](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=84172&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84044&dataset=enhanced_cps) basis. The SALT Caucus cap is projected to reduce poverty by less than 0.001%, while raising the Gini index by 0.2%.

\*Indexed for Inflation

[^4]: The Ways and Means tax bill adjusts the year at which the 35% tax bracket is uprated changing it from 2017 to 2016, thereby raising the bracket threshold higher than previously.

[^5]: In 2029, the maximum value of the CTC would drop as the temporary $500 boost expires. However, since the CTC is adjusted for inflation afterwards using 2024 as the base year, the credit’s value would fall to $2,200 rather than $2,000. Additionally, we do not include the SSN changes to the CTC in this analysis, but plan to include the provision in future reports.

# Ways and Means Committee's SALT Cap
Slug: ways-and-means-salt-cap
Date: 2025-05-14
Authors: Pavel Makarchuk, David Trimmer, Max Ghenis
Tags: us, featured, reconciliation
Description: We project that limiting state and local tax deductions to $30,000, phasing down to $10,000 at high incomes, would raise $937 billion over the budget window.

---

Earlier today, the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives voted in favor of [“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill”,](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SMITMO_017_xml.pdf) a suite of tax reforms that extends most provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while adding other reforms such as exempting tip and overtime income from taxes. Among its changes from TCJA is a higher limit on the state and local tax deduction, which is $10,000 under TCJA and uncapped after 2025 under current law. The bill caps the SALT deduction at $30,000 for taxpayers, phasing down to $10,000 for filers with income above $400,000.

We modeled the impact of this policy against a baseline with most other provisions of the Ways & Means Committee’s bill (see Appendix A).

Key results (static):

- Raises federal revenues by $937 billion from 2026 to 2035

- Reduces net income for 5.2% of Americans in 2026

- Increases the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 0.2%

- Lowers the Gini index of income inequality by 0.4%

## Summary of SALT Provisions

The SALT deduction is set to become uncapped starting in 2026 after being limited to $10,000 under the TCJA. Under the Ways and Means bill, the SALT deduction would be capped at $30,000 ($15,000 for separate filers). As Figure 1 shows, once adjusted gross income reaches $400,000 ($200,000 for separate filers), the limitation phases down at a 20% rate until reaching $10,000 ($5,000 for separate filers). This results in filers with AGI above $500,000 ($250,000 separate) facing the SALT cap floor.[^1]

[^1]: The Ways and Means bill also includes provisions that are meant to limit workarounds that states have implemented to avoid the SALT cap. We did not model these provisions in this analysis.

## Household Impacts

As we are only comparing how the SALT deduction would affect households as a part of the full bill, only households that itemize their deductions and have state and local tax expenses would be affected. For example, a single adult in New York making $500,000 and $45,000 in property taxes would see a [reduction in their net income of $21,053](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53326) in 2026.[^2] Figure 2 displays how the single adult’s net income would change as their household earnings vary. While rising at certain points, net income generally falls as household income increases.

[^2]: This assumes a home price of $2,800,000 with an average property tax rate of 1.6%.

**Figure 2: Effect of the SALT Limitation on Net Income Based on Household Earnings for a Single Filer with $30,000+ in SALT (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3196/0*1nGgDnLbZjpbceXY)

The introduction of the cap would affect the single adult’s marginal tax rates (MTRs) at various earnings levels, as shown in Figure 3. This reveals that, for instance, the phase-out beginning at $400,000 income increases the filer’s MTR by 7 percentage points. While the SALT cap phases out over the $400,000 to $500,000 income range, it only increases the MTR for the income range from $400,000 to $470,000, since the filer would take the $16,200 standard deduction once the SALT cap falls below this amount.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*2xwAC1TJdwR9oL27)

As a result of the SALT cap phase-out, the total marginal tax rate reaches 51.2% for earnings between $400,000 to $470,000.

## Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that the $30,000 SALT cap would increase federal revenues by $937 billion over the next ten years (2026–2035).[^3] For comparison, the Joint Committee on Taxation [projected](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-22-25r/) that it would raise $916 billion from 2025–2034.

[^3]: We project that state tax revenues would increase by $2.1 billion over the budget window (2026-2035).

|     2028      |                        80.0                        |

|     2032      |                       100.4                        |
|     2033      |                       105.9                        |
|     2034      |                       112.8                        |

| **2026-2035** |                     **937.2**                      |

The SALT cap would [reduce the net income of 5.2% of American residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) in 2026. The top income decile would see the greatest number of residents who are made worse off by the SALT cap.

**Figure 5: Distribution of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*bitAetgKi4pRc7eH)

Households in the top decile would pay an average of [$4,405 more](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) in taxes, a larger amount than other deciles.

**Figure 6: Average Impact of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*FvD1qldxcKtrGUPm)

When it comes to poverty and inequality, the SALT cap would, in 2026:

- [Increase poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) (as defined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) by 0.02%,

- Increase deep poverty and deep child poverty [by 0.06% and 0.11%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps), respectively,

- Reduce the Gini index of inequality [by 0.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=84006&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84008&dataset=enhanced_cps), and the top 1%’s share of net income by 1.0%

## Conclusion

Conditional on other provisions in the Ways and Means Committee’s bill, we find that its SALT cap raises federal revenues by $937 billion over ten years, assuming no behavioral responses. Our projection exceeds JCT’s by 2.2%, though we score from 2026–2035 rather than 2025–2034. The limitation would reduce the after-tax incomes of 5% of the population in 2026, with households in the top income decile experiencing the greatest losses on an [absolute basis](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps). The $30,000 cap is projected to increase poverty by 0.02%, while lowering the Gini index by 0.4%.

\*Indexed for Inflation

[^4]: The Ways and Means tax bill adjusts the year at which the 35% tax bracket is uprated changing it from 2017 to 2016, thereby raising the bracket threshold higher than previously.

[^5]: In 2029, the maximum value of the CTC would drop as the temporary $500 boost expires. However, since the CTC is adjusted for inflation afterwards using 2024 as the base year, the credit’s value would fall to $2,200 rather than $2,000. Additionally, we do not include the SSN changes to the CTC in this analysis, but plan to include the provision in future reports.

# Analyzing Energy Policy with PolicyEngine
Slug: earth-day-2025
Date: 2025-04-22
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, uk, featured
Description: We provide an Earth Day recap of our capabilities in the US and UK.

---

At PolicyEngine, our work centers on providing open and transparent tools for public policy analysis. While many analyses focus on tax and benefit programs, energy policies also have significant individual and societal effects that warrant examination.

I discussed PolicyEngine's capabilities in this area at the most recent [Open Sustainability Policy Summit](https://opensource.engineering.jhu.edu/), hosted by Johns Hopkins and LF Energy. You can watch the talk below:

<center>[Interactive: af8Y5J_jLO0]</center>

As I described (slides available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pAXVClSU1Ws7tcrpHFinGTdeHLsrZWJo_tQWmEzjXXk/preview)), our open-source platform allows users to explore the quantitative impacts of various policies, including those related to energy. Here's an overview of PolicyEngine's relevant features:

### Modeling the Individual Impacts of Energy Policies

Energy policies can affect household budgets in numerous ways. PolicyEngine uses microsimulation modeling to estimate these effects. The platform can analyze:

- **Carbon Pricing:** In the UK, we can model hypothetical policies like a [carbon tax](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/how-policyengine-estimates-the-effects-of-uk-carbon-taxes) paired with a dividend. Our UK model demonstrated the distributional effects of pairing a £100/tonne carbon tax with an £18/week universal dividend, showing potential outcomes across income and wealth levels.
- **Energy Assistance Programs:** In some US states, we model programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). For example, we can simulate Michigan's Home Heating Credit to show how benefits change based on income and heating costs, revealing implicit subsidy rates.
- **Energy Price Regulations:** We have modeled policies like the [UK's Energy Price Guarantee](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/projected-impact-of-the-uks-extended-energy-price-guarantee), which capped household energy costs.
- **Clean Energy Incentives:** We analyze individual tax credits, such as the Clean Vehicle Credit from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including eligibility rules and income interactions. You can read my [2022 UBI Center report](https://www.ubicenter.org/ira-ev-credit-cliff) for a demonstration.
- **Implicit Subsidies:** We can identify energy-related components in other programs, like the SNAP utility expense deduction.
- **State & Local Programs:** We incorporate state-specific policies, such as California's low-income electricity discounts (CARE and FERA).

### An Open, Integrated Platform

Our capabilities are built on a foundation of openness and specific data techniques:

- **Open Source:** Our entire platform – from the front-end interface to the underlying rules engine and APIs – is free and open source, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine). We leverage and contribute to the broader open-source community.
- **Data Integration:** We use techniques, including machine learning, to integrate diverse datasets (like income surveys and consumption data) to provide a detailed view of policy impacts.
- **Tools:**
  - **Individuals:** Calculate estimated taxes and benefits under current law.
  - **Analysts:** Design custom policy reforms, adjusting parameters or introducing new policies.
  - **Impact Analysis:** Compute the personalized impact of reforms on specific households and estimate the broader societal effects on metrics like poverty and inequality using microsimulation.
  - **API Access:** Third parties can build custom applications using our API.

### Future Directions in Energy & Climate Modeling

We are continuously expanding our capabilities. As discussed in the presentation, future directions include:

- **Broadening Scope:** Modeling more LIHEAP programs across the US and incorporating state-specific rules for IRA rebates.
- **Deeper Data:** Integrating more detailed utility expense data into our US models.
- **Dynamic Modeling:** Working towards integration with dynamic macroeconomic models (like OG-USA).
- **Energy & Emissions:** Exploring the integration of dedicated energy models to estimate the potential impact of policies on emissions.
- **Enhanced UX:** Improving the user experience and expanding our API for developers.
- **AI Integration:** Developing AI-powered tools, like chatbots, for policy analysis.

### Learn More

Understanding the economic and distributional effects of energy policy involves dissecting complex interactions. PolicyEngine provides transparent, accessible tools for this analysis.

# What's the SALTernative?
Slug: introducing-salternative
Date: 2025-04-21
Authors: Pavel Makarchuk, Max Ghenis
Tags: us, featured, reconciliation
Description: Introducing PolicyEngine’s free SALT‑AMT calculator — an open‑source web app to model next year’s SALT‑cap sunset, tweak AMT parameters, and see the budget, distributional, and household impacts in seconds.

---

Today we’re excited to launch **SALTernative**, a free web app that lets anyone — from researchers and journalists to households and Hill staff — simulate reforms to the state‑and‑local‑tax (SALT) deduction and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and see their effects on:

- **The federal budget** (2026–35)

- **Average household incomes** across the distribution

- **Individual households’ net income**, effective SALT caps, and property‑tax subsidy rates

You can start exploring right now at [**policyengine.org/us/salternative**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/salternative).

## Why a SALT + AMT model, and why now?

- **Major policy change may be imminent.** When individual provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire after 2025, the explicit $10,000 SALT cap vanishes and AMT parameters revert, reshaping incentives for millions of taxpayers.

- **The interaction matters.** The AMT disallows the SALT deduction, creating an _effective_ SALT cap that can remain even without a statutory cap.

- **Transparent evidence is scarce.** While existing estimates are static tables for individual reforms, SALTernative is flexible, open‑source, and free.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*-ZtaSY2laGsW2qHh)

## What you can do with SALTernative

| Question                                                                                                | How the tool helps                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _“What if we doubled the SALT cap for married couples but kept the AMT?”_                               | Toggle a checkbox and compare distributional and budget impacts side‑by‑side.                                                   |
| _“If TCJA expires, how large is the effective SALT cap for a $250,000‑income household in New Jersey?”_ | Enter the household in the **Personalized Calculator** and view the value (it depends on other factors like mortgage interest). |
| _“How much revenue would repealing both SALT and the AMT raise or lose over 2026‑35?”_                  | Run the scenario and read the ten‑year budget window total.                                                                     |

Key features at launch include:

- **Current‑law vs. current‑policy baselines.** Simulate against either an automatic TCJA sunset or a full extension.

- **Behavioral responses.** Optionally incorporate CBO elasticities so earnings adjust when marginal tax rates change.

- **Transparent methodology.** We’ve developed the tool [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/salt-amt-calculator/), using the open-source PolicyEngine US microsimulation model — including a full set of state income tax rules, critical for SALT and AMT calculations.

# MyFriendBen Launches in North Carolina, Using PolicyEngine API
Slug: myfriendben-nc
Date: 2025-04-05
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, us-nc, featured, api, benefit-access
Description: Our rules engine powers the open-source multi-benefit screener and its expansion beyond Colorado.

---

We're pleased to share that [MyFriendBen has launched in North Carolina](https://bennc.org/new-online-tool-helps-north-carolina-families-find-financial-support-in-minutes/), making it the second state where this benefits screener helps residents identify potential financial support programs they may qualify for. This expansion aligns with PolicyEngine's mission to make tax and benefits systems more transparent and accessible to all.

## A Partnership for Information Access

Durham-based nonprofit [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org), in partnership with [MyFriendBen](https://myfriendben.org) and [NC 211](https://nc211.org), has brought this tool to North Carolina residents. MyFriendBen-NC ([bennc.org](https://bennc.org)) offers North Carolinians a way to discover which benefits and tax credits they may qualify for, including food assistance, health insurance, child care subsidies, and more.

The tool integrates with [PolicyEngine's open-source API](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/api), which provides calculations for federal and state tax credits and major benefit programs like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, and TANF. By using our computational models, MyFriendBen can generate personalized reports with over 90% accuracy in approximately six minutes.

## Informing North Carolina Residents

According to Dan Rearick, Co-Executive Director of Code the Dream, many North Carolina families face financial challenges and could benefit from better information about available support programs. The tool aims to help these individuals understand their options.

In Colorado, where MyFriendBen first launched, households discovered they may be eligible for benefits with an average monthly value of $1,500. This information can help families make informed decisions about which programs to apply for.

Community partners who tested the tool have noted its practical applications:

- Prince Mundeke Mushunju from Mundeke Gospel Mission in Greensboro noted that the tool helps him provide better information when directing people to social services.
- Yanira Vanegas Scott from El Refugio in Sanford highlighted how the tool provides information to families outside standard business hours.

## Addressing Complexity

The benefits landscape can be complex and difficult to navigate. As Louise Pocock, Senior Public Benefits Analyst at Code the Dream, noted: "North Carolina families don't know about or can't access programs they are eligible for."

The combination of MyFriendBen's user interface and PolicyEngine's computational capabilities helps address this complexity. Users can complete a survey, available in 12 languages, and receive a personalized report showing which programs they may qualify for, along with estimated dollar values and application time requirements.

## The Power of Open-Source Collaboration

The MyFriendBen-NC launch exemplifies the potential of open-source collaboration in addressing social challenges. By using PolicyEngine's API to perform complex benefit calculations, the MyFriendBen team could focus on creating an accessible user experience while ensuring accurate results.

It's important to acknowledge that this success was truly collaborative. Developers and benefit experts at MyFriendBen and Code the Dream worked closely with the PolicyEngine team to develop and implement the North Carolina rules. This cross-organizational expertise was crucial in adapting the calculations to North Carolina's specific benefit structures and eligibility requirements, demonstrating how shared knowledge can create more robust solutions.

We believe this model of collaboration—where specialized tools like our API can be integrated into user-facing applications and enhanced through multi-organization partnerships—represents the future of civic technology.

## Open-Source Tools for Developers

Are you a developer or organization interested in integrating tax and benefit calculations into your own tools? The PolicyEngine API that powers MyFriendBen's calculations is available for your projects as well.

[Our open-source API](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/api) can help you:

- Calculate eligibility and benefit amounts for major programs like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, and TANF
- Estimate federal and state tax liabilities and credits
- Model the impact of policy reforms
- Create tools that help people understand their financial options

We invite developers, nonprofits, government agencies, and researchers to reach out to us at [contact@policyengine.org](mailto:contact@policyengine.org) to discuss how our API might support your work in making benefits and tax systems more transparent.

Date: 2025-04-01
Authors: Daphne Hansell
Tags: us, april-fools, featured
Description: Exploring state tax credits for charitable giving.

---

At PolicyEngine, our mission of democratizing policy analysis and modeling state tax policies relies significantly on charitable donations. Many states offer unique tax credits designed to encourage charitable contributions that support community needs. PolicyEngine is excited to begin accepting donations in more accessible ways than traditional cash donations.

Below, we highlight several state tax credits that donors can utilize to enhance their contributions:

## Maryland Venison Donation Credit

Maryland provides a [non-refundable tax credit](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/fnotes/bil_0000/sb0440.pdf) to encourage hunters to donate processed venison to charitable organizations addressing hunger. The tax credit of $75 per deer, up to $300 annually. It covers the cost of processing deer meat donated to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations.

## South Carolina Deer Processing Donation Credit

South Carolina incentivizes licensed meat processors to partner with nonprofit organizations, facilitating venison donations to help feed communities in need. The [credit is $75 per deer processed](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/title-12/chapter-6/section-12-6-3750/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20the%20credit,to%20any%20other%20taxable%20year.). It is a nonrefundable credit, applicable only in the year earned.

## Maryland Oyster Shell Recycling Credit

Recognizing the ecological importance of oyster shell recycling, Maryland offers a credit for recycling oyster shells. Residents may claim $5 for each bushel of oyster shells recycled during the tax year, up to $1,500 per taxpayer.

# Enhancing the Current Population Survey for policy analysis
Slug: enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis
Date: 2022-12-28
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, technical
Description: We've used modern data science techniques to make PolicyEngine the UK's most accurate microsimulation model. In 2023, we'll do the same in the US.

---

The [PolicyEngine US app](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us) uses a microsimulation model to compute the impact of custom tax and benefit reforms on the Current Population Survey (CPS). While the CPS is widely used for policy analysis, it contains inaccuracies that can impact the accuracy of policy simulations.

In 2023, we will enhance the CPS by integrating it with IRS tax records and reweighting it to minimize deviations from administrative aggregates. This enhanced dataset will be used in the PolicyEngine microsimulation app and will also be made available as an open resource for other policy research.

_We’re grateful to Dylan Hirsch-Shell for supporting this project._

## Why is the CPS inaccurate?

The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics run the CPS monthly. Each March, they ask deeper questions on households’ activity in the prior calendar year, in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). We use the CPS ASEC (which we refer to as the CPS) for our policy simulations, as do many other analysts; for example, the Census Bureau uses it to produce their [annual poverty report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.html). However, the CPS has several limitations that can impact its accuracy:

- It undercaptures benefits and tax credits, leading to underestimated impacts on certain populations. For example, [CPS respondents under-report SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits by about a third.](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2011/demo/SEHSD-WP2012-01.pdf)

- It [top-codes income variables above $1 million](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2019/demo/sehsd-wp2019-18.pdf), which can distort the income distribution and impact policy simulations.

- With only 100,000 households, the CPS can produce volatile estimates when broken down by subpopulations, especially at the state level.

- It lacks some important information, such as assets, that can impact taxes and benefits.

- The CPS is based on data that is 1–2 years old and is not extrapolated to predict future policy impacts.

These limitations can reduce the accuracy and usefulness of the CPS for policy simulations and other research. For example, CPS-based projections will tend to underestimate the budgetary impacts of reforming SNAP or instituting a tax on top earners, and will be unable to estimate the impacts of wealth taxes or reforms to asset limits in benefit programs.

## Our plan to enhance the CPS

To address these issues, we plan to integrate several household datasets and tune them to more closely match administrative totals. This process will involve the following steps:

1. Import the CPS and replace reported taxes and benefits with computed amounts from our microsimulation model.

1. Duplicate the CPS, remove income variables, and replace them with imputed values from [IRS tax records](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-public-use-microdata-files) using our open-source [synthimpute](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/synthimpute) software for machine learning-based quantile regression.

1. Develop a loss metric based on the differences between the survey’s aggregates and true aggregates published by the government.

1. [Use gradient descent](https://blog.policyengine.org/how-machine-learning-tools-make-policyengine-more-accurate-17af859cdd97) to adjust the household survey weights in the duplicated CPS and minimize the loss.

1. Integrate the reweighted CPS-IRS dataset with the Survey of Consumer Finances and Consumer Expenditure Survey to create a comprehensive household dataset, also with synthimpute .

1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each subnational area (state, congressional district, state legislative district, etc.) to produce weights for those areas.

The diagram below characterizes this procedure ([see it in higher quality here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1B3EqL43W-Rfbultr6fGMqURtYSiuzg-Y3PkW2vT5lxs/preview)).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*KU357kXuoE888uTy)

We have successfully implemented steps 1–5 in the UK, where our loss function has 2,664 elements.¹ While we have not yet created separate weights for each UK region, we include region-specific targets (like the CPS, the UK household survey has region identifiers).

In the US, we have completed step 1, and also made progress importing the Survey of Consumer Finances and Consumer Expenditure Survey to our data format.

## Why our approach will work

We’ve grounded our algorithm in theory and empirics to maximize accuracy.

My 2018 paper, [“Quantile regression, from linear models to trees to deep learning”](https://towardsdatascience.com/quantile-regression-from-linear-models-to-trees-to-deep-learning-af3738b527c3), compared the performance of several quantile regression techniques using holdout sets. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of such a benchmarking study, and in it I found that random forests outperformed most other models. In [follow-up research with Deepak Singh](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E8F7S1Uvfw_3PmpS226Sl1LWV5NBi0CE), we found again that random forests outperformed other models, and that matching — perhaps the most common data fusion method for economic microsimulation — performed _worse_ than any others.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2556/0*ToiaXsYBexc9tD_H)

This result aligns with the theory underpinning each method. By finding the nearest donor record, matching routines are almost built to overfit, while random forests are architected to avoid overfitting.² Overfitting matters because data fusion is not a linking problem, it is an out-of-sample prediction problem: none of the records in the PUF are in the CPS, and vice versa. We aim to predict the conditional distribution of variables using companion datasets, reflecting the uncertainty in these predictions.

Our reweighting routine also carries theoretical advantages over the state of the art. Institutions like the Census Bureau assign initial weights using a small number of covariates, without intending to correct for sampling bias in outcomes like food assistance participation. Analysts sometimes adjust these weights to consider more outcomes using nonlinear programming, which runs until all constraints are satisfied (e.g., each income category is within 5% of the true values). Gradient descent improves upon nonlinear programming by continuing the search: rather than merely looking for an acceptable solution, it finds an optimum after hundreds of searches (“epochs”). And because gradient descent powers deep learning models, computer scientists have built tools to make it run smoothly and quickly.

Since reweighting is also a prediction problem, we evaluate our method on holdout sets of metrics to avoid overfitting. My colleague Nikhil Woodruff has shown that our approach here [substantially improves accuracy](https://blog.policyengine.org/how-machine-learning-tools-make-policyengine-more-accurate-17af859cdd97) in the UK context, both against the original data and other microsimulation models.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Cr-l3U_V97HvNbi3)

Our UK documentation includes [evaluations that update each time we change the model](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-uk//model/validation.html). While we’re confident in the benefits of our two novel contributions to microsimulation data enhancement — fusing datasets with random forests-based quantile regression, and reweighting with gradient descent — we will continue experimenting with new methods and sharing our performance as the literature develops.

The CPS already produces useful projections for some policy reforms, such as national tax programs that affect the bulk of the income distribution. Our experience in the UK suggests that our data enhancement procedure can make it even more useful; we expect to cut errors by 90% for assessing more targeted policies, and also to be able to model reforms we don’t currently support, like the [newly-passed Massachusetts millionaire tax](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/what-the-millionaire-tax-in-massachusetts-means-for-the-wealthy.html).

By enhancing the CPS with IRS tax records and reweighting it to minimize deviations from administrative aggregates, we can significantly improve the accuracy of policy simulations and contribute to a more evidence-based policymaking process. We look forward to bringing these enhancements to the US and making our enhanced dataset available as an open resource for other policy research.

¹ The UK equivalents of the CPS and IRS tax records are the Family Resources Survey and Survey of Personal Incomes, respectively. Our code for enhancing UK microdata is in [this folder](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/tree/master/policyengine_uk/data/datasets/frs/enhanced) within the policyengine-uk GitHub repo.

² While we expect that deep neural networks could outperform random forests with tuning, we’ve adopted random forests for their simplicity and high baseline performance.

# How charitable contributions affect Americans' taxes
Slug: charitable-contributions
Date: 2022-11-29
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, policy
Description: PolicyEngine estimates the tax impact of your donations for free.

---

Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), when many Americans will consider giving to charity. Filers who itemize can deduct these charitable contributions from their taxable income. For many filers, these donations will reduce tax liability, either by putting them over the itemization threshold or increasing their itemized deductions.

This video shows an example of a New York resident with $200,000 in employment income and no other itemized deductions. Without charitable contributions, PolicyEngine estimates that they would owe $64,255. If they donate $20,000, they would instead owe an estimated $58,043. That is, their taxes fall by $6,212, offsetting 31% of their donation.

<div style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px"><center>[Interactive: G3CEfauQ2SQ]</center></div>

Federal taxes comprise 88% of this impact.

# Maryland's standard deduction
Slug: maryland-standard-deduction
Date: 2022-11-22
Authors: Kevin Foster
Tags: us, policy
Description: PolicyEngine computes the program's impact on Maryland and individual households.

---

Maryland’s standard deduction lowers filers’ taxable income when they do not itemize deductions. The standard deduction is 15 percent of a filer’s adjusted gross income, bounded both above and below. For head of household, joint, and widow(er) filers, the minimum standard deduction is $3,100 and the maximum is $4,700. For single and married filing separately filers, the minimum deduction is $1,550, with a maximum of $2,350.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5272/1*KJuvJ4_gO1gLkP36qqWjag.png)

Using PolicyEngine, we can compute the standard deduction’s impact. We’ll do this by comparing a policy regime without Maryland’s standard deduction to one with it.

## Defining the reform

From the Policy page, navigate to the Maryland > State income tax > Deductions > Standard section. Select the Baseline, and set the value of MD standard deduction as a percent of AGI to zero, as well as MD maximum standard deduction for each filing status using the dropdown menu. Finally, set Simulation > Geography to Maryland. This will produce [this reform link](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?md_standard_deduction_rate=15&md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=1550&md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=1550&baseline_md_standard_deduction_rate=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=0&baseline_state_specific=MD).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Tuukff7dXZRB__70)

By default, the Reform page will show the current value listed above.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*T5b8HKRCyj9-LHGf)

## Population impact

Selecting Compute population impact shows [this link](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?md_standard_deduction_rate=15&md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=1550&md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=1550&md_min_standard_deduction_WIDOW=3100&baseline_md_standard_deduction_rate=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_WIDOW=0&baseline_state_specific=MD). PolicyEngine estimates that Maryland’s standard deduction costs $417 million, benefits 90% of the population, has no effect on poverty, and slightly reduces income inequality.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*eVayVbOocgUWZl0P)

While middle income deciles benefit more than higher income deciles, households in the bottom income decile are least likely to gain from the policy, since many have no taxable income. Households in the top income decile are least likely to benefit from the standard deduction, as they are more likely to itemize their deductions instead (Maryland allows federal itemized deductions).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*2kGjmg6JRHYpCjpa)

## Impact on a single filer

Now let’s look at the impact of Maryland’s standard deduction on individual Maryland households. To see how to define a household, see our [post on the Oregon Earned Income Tax Credit](https://medium.com/policyengine/computing-your-oregon-earned-income-tax-credit-in-policyengine-d911ae29749d).

The standard deduction benefits single filers if they earn at least $13,590. Its net impact quickly rises to $112, and rises further to $129 if their income exceeds $152,100.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*QknzNotM0mGUz1fF)

The standard deduction strictly lowers marginal tax rates, by between 0.2 and 0.7 percentage points in the relevant regions, except for the negative spike at the low end.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3192/0*xzb5xyH3mopg94-l)

The sudden increase to net income (decrease to marginal tax rate) at $13,590 results from the [Poverty Line Credit](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us//gov/states/md/tax/income/credits/poverty-line-credit.html), which creates a cliff at the [poverty line](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines). By lowering the tax liability at that point, the standard deduction increases the benefit of the Poverty Line Credit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*hWlScrE0b95B9TBx)

[Repealing the Poverty Line Credit in the baseline and reform](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?md_standard_deduction_rate=15&md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=1550&md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=1550&baseline_md_standard_deduction_rate=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=0&baseline_state_specific=MD&baseline_md_poverty_line_credit_rate=0) shows that standard deduction would have a smoother impact in the absence of the Poverty Line Credit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*gLk0c9ANp3KKOSBK)

## Impact on a family of four

For a family of four (married with two children) with $100,000 in employment income, the standard deduction lowers taxes by $223.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*WXnAsrE2npPKKf-T)

Select Compute how earnings affect you to see how the standard deduction affects this household’s net income. Then select the Difference button to generate the below chart. The dip around $42,000 results from [Maryland’s earned income tax credit](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us//gov/states/md/tax/income/credits/eitc.html), which is partially nonrefundable and therefore affected by tax liability.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*S9bfltBYrvHgpMx-)

We can similarly see a smoother impact by repealing the Maryland EITC in the baseline and reform. Since the Poverty Line Credit fills in the EITC, we need to [repeal both](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?md_standard_deduction_rate=15&md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=3100&md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=1550&md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=1550&baseline_md_standard_deduction_rate=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_JOINT=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SEPARATE=0&baseline_md_min_standard_deduction_SINGLE=0&baseline_state_specific=MD&baseline_md_non_single_childless_non_refundable_eitc_match=0&baseline_md_eitc_refundable_match=0&baseline_md_poverty_line_credit_rate=0).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*fnz-UD2-g9iOg7dM)

Here we’ve shown the impact of Maryland’s standard deduction, including how it interacts with other tax programs. To compute the impact of other tax and benefit programs, try PolicyEngine US at [policyengine.org](https://legacy.policyengine.org/).

# Oregon's Nonrefundable Exemption Credit
Slug: oregons-nonrefundable-exemption-credit
Date: 2022-11-04
Authors: Kevin Foster
Tags: us, us-or, policy
Description: PolicyEngine computes the program's impact on Oregon and individual households.

---

Oregon’s nonrefundable exemption credit was created in 1983 to replace the personal exemption deduction. Since 1987, the state has indexed the credit to inflation. As a nonrefundable credit, its value is capped at one’s tax liability. Single and married filing separately statuses can claim the credit if their income does not exceed $100,000. For other statuses, the income cap is $200,000. In the 2022 tax year, eligible filers could claim a $219 credit for themselves, their spouse, and any dependents in the household. They can also claim additional exemptions if the filer or their spouse is severely disabled, or if they have a disabled child.

Using PolicyEngine, we can compute the exemption credit’s impact on the state of Oregon and individual households.

## The Household Impact

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*LZy0ZwVxCVavnySk)

The exemption credit for a family of four (married with two children) is shown above. Making under $200,000 provides a credit of $876 ($219 \* 4). To see how to define a household, check out our [post on the Oregon Earned Income Tax Credit](https://medium.com/policyengine/computing-your-oregon-earned-income-tax-credit-in-policyengine-d911ae29749d).

Due to the credit’s non-refundability, the value phases in. The household would have to earn $21,000 to see the full value of the credit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*jjLy3TSyK27f_BLM)

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Estimating Impacts of Oregon’s Exemption Credit

Select “compute the impact of policy reforms,” then “States.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ghZpH0nxhUlwAPjK)

Enter “Oregon” for your state, then click through “taxes,” “income,” and “credits.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*A2uFMhgNLOIp6ho9)

Then, select “Exemption,” followed by “Oregon exemption amount.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*E8hteUf208jz4WKf)

Enter 0 for the amount. You can also name your policy in the top right (“Repealing Oregon’s exemption credit” in this example).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*naEdP4RCvdDCWjCc)

Then, press the arrows next to the “against” tab, followed by setting the reform to “in Oregon.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*9J2--Cm1sio--nRa)

Select “Calculate economic impact” and choose which metric you would like to view (budgetary impact below)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*jNzuIY1ZmfdlBan5)

We estimate that Oregon’s exemption credit [cost $645.5 million in 2022](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=or&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3349), [reduced poverty 0%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=or&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3349), and [increased the average household’s net income by $365](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=2&region=or&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3349). As a comparison, Oregon estimates that the credit cost about $650 million in 2021.[^1]

# PolicyEngine launches in Washington state
Slug: policyengine-launches-in-washington-state
Date: 2022-08-10
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, technical, us-wa
Description: Washingtonians can now compute the impacts of the Working Families Tax Credit and federal reforms.

---

Washington state hasn’t historically had an income tax. However, in the past year, they’ve enacted a [Working Families Tax Credit](https://workingfamiliescredit.wa.gov/) (modeled after the federal Earned Income Tax Credit) and a [capital gains tax](https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/other-taxes/capital-gains-tax)¹ (which is currently held up in court). With support from the [Center for Growth and Opportunity](http://thecgo.org), we’ve now modeled these policies in PolicyEngine and enabled Washington-specific impacts of federal reforms. This blog post shows a series of examples on using PolicyEngine in Washington.

You can use our [household calculator](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household) to estimate how much you’ll get from the Washington Working Families Tax Credit under current law.²

<center>[Interactive: bBHncBDrH98]</center>

Using PolicyEngine’s Baseline feature, you can also compute the impact of the Working Families Tax Credit by [comparing it against a baseline where it doesn’t exist](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=300&wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=600&wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=900&wa_wftc_max_amount_4_rate=1200&wa_wftc_min_amount=50&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_max_amount_4_rate=0&baseline_wa_wftc_min_amount=0&baseline_state_specific=WA).³

<center>[Interactive: Tdwfw6tk3vk]</center>

PolicyEngine lets you imagine a range of policy reforms. For example, what if the Working Families Tax Credit were $100 more generous? This video shows how to build [that policy](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?wa_wftc_max_amount_0_rate=400&wa_wftc_max_amount_1_rate=700&wa_wftc_max_amount_2_rate=1000&wa_wftc_max_amount_3_rate=1300&baseline_state_specific=WA) and compute its impact on Washington overall and a Washington family of four.

<center>[Interactive: 3h2KN jXsBc]</center>

Finally, you can also compute the impact of federal policy reforms on Washington state; for instance, [cutting the bottom tax rate from 10% to 5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?gov_irs_income_bracket_rates_1=5&baseline_state_specific=WA).

<center>[Interactive: gn5cJ24Vzzo]</center>

To learn more about PolicyEngine in Washington, feel free to contact us at [hello@policyengine.org](mailto:hello@policyengine.org). And be sure to [follow PolicyEngine](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=thepolicyengine) to stay updated on our new features and states.

¹ Since Washington’s capital gains tax has a $250,000 standard deduction and the Current Population Survey truncates income, PolicyEngine underestimates the revenue from the policy.

² PolicyEngine only provides estimates of taxes and benefits. Our policy parameters are based on preliminary estimates from the Washington Department of Revenue, which they may revise by September 2022. See [this discussion](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/openfisca-us/discussions/1246) for more information and consult a tax advisor.

³ PolicyEngine shows that the Working Families Tax Credit increases the share of income held by the top 10% because some high-income Current Population Survey households in Washington include tax filers that is eligible for the credit. In the future, we will avoid these small-N sources of volatility by using the full CPS for each state, reweighted to resemble a state according to various aggregate statistics.

# Electric vehicle tax credits under current law and the Inflation Reduction Act

Description: Use PolicyEngine US to analyze provisions of the potential reconciliation bill.

---

Today’s tax code provides a credit of up to $7,500 for purchasing a new electric vehicle. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) last week would reform this credit and create a new one for purchasing used electric vehicles (EVs). PolicyEngine US now models all of these provisions for households.

While PolicyEngine lets you adjust a range of policy parameters for the current law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the simplest way to explore the IRA is to turn it on. This video shows how to do that and compute the [IRA’s impact on the buyer of a used EV](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?inflation_reduction_act_in_effect=1).

<center>[Interactive: _Y0EWjmHyy0]</center>

Electric vehicle credits are non-refundable, meaning they do not lower a household’s tax liability below zero. As we show in our [model documentation](https://policyengine.github.io/openfisca-us//programs/irs/credits/electric-vehicle-credit.html), this results in lower-income households receiving less net benefit.

![Net impact of a $7,500 electric vehicle credit for an unmarried tax filer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*u9BoRkwb11WE-WS_)_Net impact of a $7,500 electric vehicle credit for an unmarried tax filer_

The Inflation Reduction Act limits the EV credits by household income, changes the formula for new EV credits, and introduces a used EV credit of up to $4,000. PolicyEngine models the impacts of those policies and current law for individual households; we do not yet compute the population impacts.

Description: You design the policy. We compute the poverty, inequality, and budgetary impacts.

Since we [beta-launched PolicyEngine US in March](https://blog.policyengine.org/policyengine-comes-stateside-cef88b122e48), we’ve been working on two major new features: (a) state taxes and benefits, and (b) microdata for population-level analysis. We’re thrilled to share that we’ve launched an initial version of the latter. When you create a custom tax and benefit reform, you can now see the impact beyond a single household, zooming out to the US-wide impacts on poverty, inequality, and the budget.

## Case study: the End Child Poverty Act

As a case study, consider the [End Child Poverty Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6598?s=1&r=4) (ECPA), which Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-MA) and Mondaire Jones (D-NY) introduced in February 2022. This bill replaces the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit with a universal child allowance, an adult dependent credit, and a filer credit. [You can see a simulation of the End Child Poverty Act’s impact in PolicyEngine US here.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?abolish_eitc=1&end_child_poverty_act_adult_dependent_credit_amount=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_JOINT=1200&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SEPARATE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SINGLE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_WIDOW=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_JOINT=40000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SEPARATE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SINGLE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_WIDOW=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_rate=5&young_child_bi=4716&older_child_bi_age=19&abolish_non_refundable_ctc=1&abolish_refundable_ctc=1&young_adult_bi_age=20)

The Population Impact page starts with a disclaimer about the data (see the *Caveats *section of this post below), as well as some high-level measures of the reform’s impact.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*FjhnllD4qmxZ7VU5)

Next is a breakdown of the budgetary impact, showing that the ECPA’s $242 billion net cost comprises $347 billion in benefit outlays, less $104 billion in tax revenues (in this case, repealed tax credits).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*_X7ok61wCzUpisU9)

Next, we show the impact on poverty by age group, using the [Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html). You can also toggle the switch to view the impact on deep poverty, the population share whose household income is less than half their poverty threshold.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*U1_M0nGig_uxktg7)

We then show a common distributional chart: the average impact by income decile. Switch from relative to absolute to see the impact in dollars rather than a percent of the decile’s initial net income (after taxes and benefits).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*gCvfQcPo2JBtnOe1)

While the above chart shows the average change, reforms rarely affect everyone in each decile equally. The following chart breaks down the members of each income decile based on whether the reform strongly increases or decreases their net income (5% or more), mildly increases or decreases their net income (less than 5%), or does not affect them.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*m-KnmZb9JsxYuCt5)

Finally, the Population Impact screen shows how the reform affects three measures of income inequality: the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), a broad statistical measure; the share of net income held by the top 10%; and the share of net income held by the top 1%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*GkAw2gWXxfWf2T3R)

You can also see the [End Child Poverty Act’s impact on Massachusetts](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?abolish_eitc=1&end_child_poverty_act_adult_dependent_credit_amount=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_JOINT=1200&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SEPARATE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SINGLE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_WIDOW=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_JOINT=40000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SEPARATE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SINGLE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_WIDOW=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_rate=5&young_child_bi=4716&older_child_bi_age=19&abolish_non_refundable_ctc=1&abolish_refundable_ctc=1&young_adult_bi_age=20&baseline_state_specific=MA) by selecting Massachusetts from the _Simulation > Geography_ page on the Policy screen. We’ll add more states to that drop-down as we implement more state income tax systems.

\*Note: Our nationwide estimates of policy reforms keep state income taxes fixed at the values CPS respondents report. We simulate state income taxes only for state-specific analyses. The ECPA leaves some people worse off in the Massachusetts analysis because it repeals the EITC, which Massachusetts partially matches in its tax code.\

As always, users can view the reform’s personalized impact by selecting the [_Your household_ tab](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?abolish_eitc=1&end_child_poverty_act_adult_dependent_credit_amount=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_JOINT=1200&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SEPARATE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SINGLE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_WIDOW=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_JOINT=40000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SEPARATE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SINGLE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_WIDOW=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_rate=5&young_child_bi=4716&older_child_bi_age=19&abolish_non_refundable_ctc=1&abolish_refundable_ctc=1&young_adult_bi_age=20) at the top.

## Caveats

The PolicyEngine US Population Impact page uses the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS) March Supplement, a representative household survey that powers many tax and benefit microsimulation analyses. The CPS covers many topics, from household structure and demographics to income and benefit receipt, but it has several drawbacks when it comes to microsimulation:

- Truncated incomes. The CPS truncates high incomes for privacy. This means that PolicyEngine US will underestimate the magnitude of tax reforms affecting high earners.

- Underestimated benefits. Aggregate benefits in the CPS fall short of administrative totals. We recalculate benefits from current rules for households that reported receiving them, which shrinks the gap, but PolicyEngine US still underestimates the magnitude of benefit reforms.

- 2020 data, 2022 policy. The latest CPS reflects households’ activity throughout calendar year 2020. PolicyEngine US currently applies 2022 tax and benefit policy to household information from 2020, which further underestimates incomes.

- Lack of detail for more specific income types. For example, the CPS asks about total capital gains, so we currently assume that all are long-term.

- Small sample sizes at the state level. The. For example, we currently have Massachusetts tax and benefit policy.

## Next steps

We are partnering with the [Center for Growth and Opportunity](http://thecgo.org) to enhance the CPS data in OpenFisca US. In the coming months, we will address the aforementioned shortcomings with five sets of improvements:

1. Impute missing data from other datasets. For example, we will impute filers’ short-term share of capital gains from the IRS Public Use File and household assets (which affect benefit eligibility) from the Survey of Consumer Finances, using our [synthimpute](https://github.com/policyengine/synthimpute) machine learning software.

1. Augment income with synthetic imputations from the IRS Public Use File (PUF). The PUF is a restricted dataset containing a sample of scrubbed tax records. We will replicate tax units in the CPS and replace income data with imputed values from the PUF, preserving privacy while capturing the true distribution of income — especially at the high end.

1. Extrapolate data. We will apply government projections of earnings, prices, and population to extrapolate survey datasets, which often lag by a year or more, to the current year and over the ten-year budget window.

1. Reweight the data to better match administrative totals. [As we’ve done in PolicyEngine UK](https://blog.policyengine.org/how-machine-learning-tools-make-policyengine-more-accurate-17af859cdd97), we will ingest administrative totals across various dimensions — income, demographics, taxes, and benefits — and apply gradient descent to minimize the discrepancies against these targets. This step follows our stacking of the CPS atop the PUF-imputed CPS, allowing the optimizer to select and weigh the types of data sources that best model the US population and economy.

1. Create enhanced datasets for each state. We will apply the above gradient descent methodology to the full CPS in each state, evening out the raw CPS’s volatile state-level estimates.

We’re excited to see what our users discover about the tax and benefit system by exploring this major new feature, and we can’t wait to make it even more accurate with these enhancements soon.

# PolicyEngine arrives stateside
Slug: policyengine-comes-stateside
Date: 2022-03-31
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, impact
Description: Today, we're beta-launching PolicyEngine US and several other new features.

---

Last October, we [launched PolicyEngine UK](https://blog.policyengine.org/make-everyone-a-policymaker-dc7b00bdb143), bringing free, open-source, web-based tax and benefit analysis to the UK for the first time. Since then, users have asked us one question more than any other: “When is it coming to the US?” This isn’t too surprising; after all, half our founding team (me) is American.

Well, fellow Yanks, the wait is over. Today, we’re beta-launching PolicyEngine US! To try it, visit [\*\*policyengine.org/us](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us)** or check out the big American flag at [**policyengine.org](https://legacy.policyengine.org/)**. Did I mention we’re also launching a [**policyengine.org](https://legacy.policyengine.org)\*\* homepage today?

![[PolicyEngine homepage](http://legacy.policyengine.org)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7636/1*VWLFVXNrF1Gss2euuXE7tA.png)_[PolicyEngine homepage](http://legacy.policyengine.org)_

If you’ve used PolicyEngine UK, the US interface will look familiar, though without the society-wide impact page and with a different default screen. If you’re new to PolicyEngine, you can now see how to use it by clicking the question mark in the bottom left, which shows a brief demo.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7636/1*S5B_j1lpVm6TuPnbZCzfYQ.png)

In fact, here are all the things we’re launching:

- [PolicyEngine US beta](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us)

- [PolicyEngine homepage](https://legacy.policyengine.org)

- Demo walkthrough

- Counterfactuals, allowing you to change baseline policy (in the UK and US)

- UK forecasts in our microsimulation model

- [API documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-kRDOssYyRwEVTsntqGxoBtvFS4HKMQD-U0Ga9YzJE/) (if you want to estimate taxes or benefits in your app, get in touch)

OK, back to PolicyEngine US. Why the beta? Well, it’s not nearly complete. Here’s what we have so far:

- Federal personal income taxes

- Payroll taxes

- Affordable Connectivity Program

- Lifeline

- Free and reduced school meals

- Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

- California’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

- California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project

This is only a subset of US benefit programs — many of which vary by state — and we don’t yet have state income taxes. We also don’t compute impacts on societal measures like poverty, inequality, and the budget. And while we’ve tested it extensively, it’s not yet as thoroughly vetted as the UK model (as always, consult a tax or benefit advisor, as our estimates aren’t official).

PolicyEngine US might not yet check all of PolicyEngine UK’s boxes, but it does break new ground. To our knowledge, it is the only app to compute both the full US tax system and benefit programs for households, and the only app to interactively model benefit policy reforms. We also have some benefits that other calculators don’t, like broadband and electric vehicle subsidies, and we’re the first open source benefit model in the country.

<center>[Interactive: GUX665_cgbQ]</center>

Most of all, we’re excited by the precedent PolicyEngine US sets. Even before we launched PolicyEngine UK, we were building PolicyEngine US, and we knew that if we could make it work in two countries, we could make it work worldwide. We now believe our multi-country progress demonstrates that UK residents won’t be alone in being able to compute the impact of their government’s policies for long. Whether it comes from us or another organization, everyone will eventually have transparent policy analysis at their fingertips — it’s just a matter of time and resources.

We have a long way to go to bring all our UK features to the US. The US tax and benefit system is, in many ways, 52 systems: one for each of the 50 states, DC, and the US overall. Some programs, like Housing Choice Vouchers and Child Care Development Fund subsidies, even vary by county. To stay updated on our progress, [sign up for our mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/7b89fef927ca/general) or follow our [social](http://twitter.com/thepolicyengine) [media](http://facebook.com/thepolicyengine) [accounts](https://linkedin.com/company/thepolicyengine). You can help us make the rest happen with a [tax-deductible gift](https://opencollective.com/psl), or by [contributing to our code base](http://github.com/policyengine). If you’re a developer or researcher, you can also use our microsimulation model programmatically via our [OpenFisca US Python package](http://openfisca.us).

To compute the impact of US tax and benefit policy on your own household, give PolicyEngine US a try at [**policyengine.org/us**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us). You can also learn more about the product on Monday at 11:30AM ET at the [Policy Simulation Library Demo Day](http://pslmodels.org/events.html). As always, feel free to [reach out](http://contact@policyengine.org) with any questions or feedback.

_We’re grateful to other tax and benefit models, from the Policy Simulation Library’s open-source [Tax-Calculator](http://taxcalc.pslmodels.org) to [snapscreener.com](https://www.snapscreener.com/) to the Atlanta Fed’s [Policy Rules Database](https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-income-families/policy-rules-database), and to our [open-source](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/openfisca-us/graphs/contributors) [contributors](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine/graphs/contributors)_,_ for aiding in this launch._

# How to simulate basic and guaranteed income policies in PolicyEngine US
Slug: how-to-simulate-basic-and-guaranteed-income-policies-in-policyengine-us
Date: 2022-09-27
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, technical
Description: From universal basic income to age-dependent means-tested payments, we've got you covered.

---

_The [UBI Center](http://ubicenter.org) contributed basic income policy parameters to PolicyEngine._

With PolicyEngine US, you can adjust hundreds of parameters defining federal and state tax and benefit programs, and then compute how adjusting those programs would affect society and households. But did you know you can also model policies that don’t currently exist, like basic income?

To define policies that don’t exist, scroll past the _Simulation, US government_, and _State government_ parameter menus in our [_Policy_ page](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy) and select _Third party_. Here you’ll find third-party-contributed policy parameters. Currently that includes _Congress_, which shows parameters that characterize the End Child Poverty Act (more on that below), and _UBI Center_,¹ which shows parameters that characterize basic or guaranteed income policies (we use the term _basic income_). Before it was signed into law, we characterized policies in the Inflation Reduction Act in the _Third party > Congress_ menu, too.

![Part of PolicyEngine’s basic income parameter menu from a mobile device.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-OToQxH1XvFoz4nqT73DXA.png)_Part of PolicyEngine’s basic income parameter menu from a mobile device._

In this blog post, we’ll show you how to design and compute the impact of basic income policies covering a range of parameters. We’ll do this through the lens of four example reforms:

1. Universal basic income - example: Applying the [Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend](https://pfd.alaska.gov/) nationwide

2. Age-dependent basic income - example: [End Child Poverty Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6598/text?r=4&s=1), a bill from Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Mondaire Jones

3. Phasing out basic income as a percent over a threshold - example: [Seed Money Act](https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/the-plan), a proposal from [End Poverty Make Trillions](https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/)²

4. Phasing out basic income over an income range - example: [Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDFPwUYu2Rf4RGgXuOTacmBj2Gt9paAV/view), a proposal from the [Economic Security Project](https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/) and the [New School](https://www.newschool.edu/)

After you’ve created any of these policies, you can compute the impact on the population (budget, poverty, and inequality), both to the US or within a state, and also compute the impact on a given household. To learn more about these impacts, see our blog posts on the [PolicyEngine US household calculator](https://blog.policyengine.org/policyengine-comes-stateside-cef88b122e48) and [population impact page](https://blog.policyengine.org/the-new-policyengine-us-population-impact-page-de68cb4ba71a).

## Universal basic income

The first policy switch under _Amounts_ is the simplest: an unconditional, universal cash payment to every member of the population. By default, it does not affect any other taxes or benefits, has no means test, and increases the income of each person by the same amount.

### Example: Applying the [Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend](https://pfd.alaska.gov/) nationwide

Suppose the US implemented its own version of [Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend](https://pfd.alaska.gov/). Since 1982, Alaska has given each resident a share of the return on its sovereign wealth fund, funded by oil revenue. The most recent payment, in 2021, was [$1,114 per person](https://pfd.alaska.gov/Division-Info/summary-of-dividend-applications-payments).

To simulate that policy nationwide, enter 1114 in the top _Basic income_ parameter.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*eqOCDQgqARfOKWf2)

[See the impact of a $1,114 per person payment in PolicyEngine here.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?bi_amount=1114)

## Age-dependent basic income

To design basic income policies that grant different amounts to different age groups, use the controls in the _Amounts_ tab. These controls let you use five age-based basic income levels:

- Young children (under age 6)

- Older children (6 to 17)

- Young adults (18 to 24)

- Older adults (25 to 64)

- Senior citizens (65 or older)

You can adjust the age bounds and set the basic income amount for each of these age groups.

### Example: [End Child Poverty Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6598/text?r=4&s=1), a bill from Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Mondaire Jones

The End Child Poverty Act would:

1. Provide a basic income for each child equal to the difference between the [poverty line](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines) for a one- and two-person household; currently, that’s $4,720 per year ($393 per month)

1. Create a refundable credit of $600 per adult dependent

1. Create a refundable credit of $600 per filer ($1,200 for joint filers), phasing out at 5% for income above $20,000 ($40,000 for joint filers)

1. Repeal the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit

To model the basic income for children, skip the first basic income amount and enter 4720 in the _Young child basic income_ box. Then to apply it to all children up to age 18, enter 19 in the _Older child basic income age_ box. To avoid overlapping age ranges, the last step is entering 20 (or any age between 20 and 24) in the _Young adult basic income age_ box.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*5UFNDEwvxpq5BepR)

You can use the _Third party > Congress > House > Rep Tlaib_ parameter menus to specify provisions 2 and 3, and the _US government > IRS > Credits > {Child, Earned income} tax credit > General_ parameter menus to specify provision 4.

[See the End Child Poverty Act in PolicyEngine here.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?abolish_eitc=1&end_child_poverty_act_adult_dependent_credit_amount=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_JOINT=1200&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SEPARATE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_SINGLE=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_amount_WIDOW=600&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_JOINT=40000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SEPARATE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_SINGLE=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_start_WIDOW=20000&end_child_poverty_act_filer_credit_phase_out_rate=5&young_child_bi=4716&older_child_bi_age=19&abolish_non_refundable_ctc=1&abolish_refundable_ctc=1&young_adult_bi_age=20&young_child_bi_amount=4720)

[This blog post](https://blog.policyengine.org/the-new-policyengine-us-population-impact-page-de68cb4ba71a) describes population-level results of the End Child Poverty Act in PolicyEngine. Numbers differ slightly as we’ve since updated from 2020 to 2021 data.

## Phasing out basic income as a percent over a threshold

The basic income policies we’ve described so far have set amounts at the individual level. PolicyEngine also supports filer-level amounts as a share of the filer’s [federal poverty line](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines). In 2022, the federal poverty line in the contiguous US was $13,590 for a single person and $4,720 for each subsequent member.

### Example: [Seed Money Act](https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/the-plan), a proposal from [End Poverty Make Trillions](https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/)

The Seed Money Act provides a grant equal to 100% of the poverty line. Its proposal document also suggests taxing the grant back for higher earners (effectively phasing it out) and repealing benefit programs. [This blog post](https://endpovertymaketrillions.medium.com/economic-modeling-of-how-to-end-poverty-in-the-united-states-while-saving-taxpayers-trillions-of-1679b751d0c0) from End Poverty Make Trillions uses PolicyEngine to explore a range of policy options; of these, we consider the option that phases out at 50% and does not replace existing programs.

To model the basic income at 100% of the poverty line, scroll to the bottom of the _Amounts_ parameter menu and enter 100 in the _Basic income as a percent of tax unit’s poverty line_ box.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*p73Tm_diUvxXjRlK)

Then enter 50 in the _Basic income phase-out rate_ box in the _Phase-out_ menu.

[See the above-described version of the Seed Money Act in PolicyEngine here.³](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?bi_fpg_percent=100&bi_phase_out_rate=50)

## Phasing out basic income over an income range

Rather than phasing out the benefit as a rate above a threshold, some proposals phase it out linearly from the threshold to a higher income value. This can be equivalent for childless households, but if the phase-out ranges only vary with filing status and the benefit has a child element, they create faster phase-outs for households with more children. We support filing status-specific phase-out income ranges.

### Example: [Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDFPwUYu2Rf4RGgXuOTacmBj2Gt9paAV/view), a proposal from the [Economic Security Project](https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/) and the [New School](https://www.newschool.edu/)

In 2021, the Economic Security Project commissioned a report from the New School to study what they called “Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century”. This policy:

- Guarantees $12,500 per adult and $4,500 per child

- Phases out between $10,000 and $50,000 adjusted gross income ($15,000 to $70,000 for joint filers)

- Repeals the Earned Income Tax Credit

To model the phase-out, go to the _Phase-out_ menu and make the following entries:

1. Enter 10000 in the _Basic income phase-out threshold_ box for heads of household (the first filing status in the drop-down menu)

1. Repeat (1) for all other filing statuses, setting the joint value to 15000

1. Toggle off the _Phase out basic income as a rate_ switch

1. Enter 50000 in the _Basic income phase-out end_ box for heads of household

1. Repeat (4) for all other filing statuses, setting the joint value to 70000

Your screen should look like this once this step is complete:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*6PcRNyg6HdZgw9fu)

Then define the basic income amounts ($4,500 for the two child categories and $12,500 for the three adult categories) and repeal the EITC using the steps from the End Child Poverty Act section of this post.

[See Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century in PolicyEngine here.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/population-impact?young_child_bi=4500&older_child_bi=4500&young_adult_bi=12500&older_adult_bi=12500&senior_bi=12500&bi_phase_out_threshold_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=10000&bi_phase_out_threshold_JOINT=15000&bi_phase_out_threshold_SEPARATE=10000&bi_phase_out_threshold_SINGLE=10000&bi_phase_out_threshold_WIDOW=10000&bi_phase_out_by_rate=0&bi_phase_out_end_HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD=50000&bi_phase_out_end_JOINT=70000&bi_phase_out_end_SEPARATE=50000&bi_phase_out_end_SINGLE=50000&bi_phase_out_end_WIDOW=50000&abolish_eitc=1&older_adult_bi_amount=12500&older_child_bi_amount=4500&senior_bi_amount=12500&young_adult_bi_amount=12500&young_child_bi_amount=4500)

Through these four policies, we’ve shown how to use PolicyEngine to compute the impact of basic income policies that vary in their amounts, age distribution, and phase-out. PolicyEngine has more controls we haven’t covered, like setting hard income limits (with no phase-out) and making the payments taxable.

So what basic or guaranteed income policies would you design? [Let us know!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20this%20basic%20income%20policy%20I%20made%20with%20@ThePolicyEngine%20[add%20your%20policyengine.org%20link])

[1] The [UBI Center](http://ubicenter.org) is a think tank that researches basic income policies. The UBI Center incubated PolicyEngine before we spun off in 2021.

[2] End Poverty Make Trillions (EPMT) has donated to PolicyEngine.

[3] Current results differ from EPMT’s blog post because EPMT approximated the federal poverty guideline with individualized amounts. We added the option to define basic income as a percent of the poverty line after EPMT published their blog post.

# PolicyEngine launches in New York state
Slug: policyengine-launches-in-new-york-state
Date: 2022-10-21
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, policy
Description: New Yorkers can now estimate their state income taxes alongside federal taxes and benefits — and change the rules, too.

---

New York state taxes individual income at rates ranging from 4% to 10.9%. But it also has a slew of income adjustments, supplementary rates, deductions, exemptions, and credits. Short of using tax software in April or hiring a tax accountant, how can you estimate your tax bill?

[**New Yorkers can now use the free PolicyEngine app to find out.**](http://legacy.policyengine.org)[^1] We capture all those rules, and show your estimated state taxes (including tax credits) in the same view as your federal taxes and benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*sqsx67qxDSL6WpYE)

What’s more, you can customize New York’s tax policy and have PolicyEngine estimate how that new policy would affect New York[^2] and your own household. For example, this video estimates the impact of expanding New York’s Earned Income Tax Credit.

<center>[Interactive: jZUC9PrZe4Q]</center>

From Governor Hochul to think tanks to families trying to better understand their own finances, we hope New Yorkers of all stripes will find valuable information in our free, open source tax model.[^3]

Authors: Kevin Foster

Description: We walk you through it step by step.

The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a federal tax credit for low-income filers with earned income. The credit is refundable, meaning that the taxpayer can receive money back in the form of a refund if their tax liability is reduced below zero. [Oregon is one of 29 states](https://www.taxcreditsforworkersandfamilies.org/state-tax-credits/) or similar program to the federal EITC.

## Introduction to the Oregon EITC

The Oregon EITC has two elements. For filers with children under three years old, the state provides 12% of the federal EITC. For filers without young children, Oregon matches 9% of the federal EITC. PolicyEngine has now modeled the Oregon EITC match, along with other credits and subtractions. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the process of estimating your EITC match in Oregon using PolicyEngine.

## Example: Single Parent with $30,000 Employment Income and Two Children

Consider a single parent with $30,000 employment income and two children, aged two and four, respectively. By following the steps outlined below, you can estimate the amount of Oregon EITC you are eligible for in 2022.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Estimating Your Oregon EITC in PolicyEngine

Select “Compute my household income” on the left, then “Enter my household.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*BZcMhZhhEGtlx9nu)

Enter your marital status as “Single,” followed by two dependents.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*6rDvjb_CApdU-Dgp)

In the dropdown, select “Oregon” as your state.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*bfcoGajoaxjJvd0I)

Enter your employment income ($30,000 in this example).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*hjv0AkyVkHqjZnAX)

Next, enter your age, and the ages of the children (in this example, age two and four).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7680/1*4jU0hHp0--fS3oMlRWR-Gg.png)

With your net income displayed at the top, click the “Your refundable tax credits,” then “Your Oregon refundable tax credits.” The dropdown will display your OR EITC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*EzWn-Al88mSROJko)

In this example, the estimated Oregon EITC is $579. That is, a single parent with $30,000 employment income and children aged two and four will receive $579 from the Oregon EITC in 2022.

## Conclusion

To estimate your own Oregon EITC, or other taxes and benefits, visit policyengine.org. Remember, these are just estimates and the actual amount you receive may be different. For more information on the EITC and other tax credits, visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website.

Low-income seniors and people with disabilities can claim [Supplemental Security Income](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/), a monthly cash benefit run by the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/). Last year, [over 7 million people claimed over $50 billion in SSI benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/budget/FY22Files/2022BO.pdf).

In this post, you’ll see how to estimate your own SSI benefits based on your income using the [free PolicyEngine US web app](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us). You can also watch it in the below 90-second video.

<center>[Interactive: hqId_2EJy9o]</center>

To start, visit [\*\*policyengine.org](https://legacy.policyengine.org/)** and click **Enter PolicyEngine US\*\*.

Go to the **Your household** tab to enter your household’s info. Let’s say we’re a single parent of one disabled child with $30,000 income. Click **1** in the **Dependents** section.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4228/1*5HwxclNO_eVCNnzQH95MBA.png)

In the **Income** menu, enter **$30,000** under **Employment income**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4228/1*oZ3CRAEsSnrvyVyjNYOY4w.png)

In the **Demographics** menu, select the **You** drop-down in the upper right corner, and select **Your first dependent.** Scroll down to toggle the **SSI disabled** flag.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4228/1*NL9U8j7SGxkDvV73kfUW8w.png)

Now click **Compute your net income.** SSI is in the **Benefits** section of the expandable table. This household would receive $5,934 per year (in 2022), or about $495 per month. This also assumes the household meets other requirements such as asset limits.

# Updating PolicyEngine to reflect SNAP reform in the omnibus bill

A step-by-step guide to syncing our code with the latest legislation

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5812/1*yzcpIgHZDulGcD9o8Qqaag.png)

The US Senate has recently passed the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF), also known as the omnibus bill. If the House of Representatives and President Biden sign it, it will create or amend several federal programs. One of these programs is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is modeled by PolicyEngine in the US. The omnibus bill will terminate SNAP emergency allotments after February 2023 payments. Previously, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act authorized emergency allotments to provide additional assistance to SNAP-eligible households. PolicyEngine uses a [dataset of emergency allotment policies from snapscreener.com](https://www.snapscreener.com/blog/emergency-allotments), which currently shows that emergency allotments are active in 34 states and the District of Columbia.

In the accompanying video, we demonstrate the process we follow to update our open source code to reflect policy reforms such as this one. This process includes [filing an issue](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/1591), creating a new Git branch, writing a test using test-driven development, updating the logic, and passing the test before [filing a pull request](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/pull/1592).

<center>[Interactive: lW83x3JgNcU]</center>

If you are interested in contributing to our open source software, we welcome assistance with modeling new policies, improving our architecture, and building user-friendly experiences for those learning about taxes and benefits or designing policy reforms.

# From idea to impact: scoring a policy reform on the new PolicyEngine US

Description: A walkthrough of the new app on a US tax-benefit reform.

---

One of the most talked-about reforms of the last few years has been making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable (enabling it to reduce federal income tax liabilities below zero). Let’s walk through how to model it in PolicyEngine.

## The landing page

The landing page now has a new look. We know that PolicyEngine users usually fall into two categories: people who want to calculate their household’s taxes and benefits (sometimes under a policy reform), and people who want to run economic analyses of custom-built policy reforms (and also simulate example households). So we’ve split these use-cases up on the landing page.

We’re interested in building a new reform, so we’ll select _Compute the impact of policy reforms_.

## Building a policy

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*4DGD1Jbyq5ljyNxX)

_The policy builder page on PolicyEngine._

On this part of the app, we can specify the details of our policy reform, and simulate it on the economy. There are three panes in this view.

The _left pane_ is for navigation: use this to select what the middle pane should be showing. The top half is a menu of all the _input parameters_: policy parameters you can change to build a reform (for example, the first rate of federal income tax). The bottom half is a menu of all the _outputs_: things the model can tell you about how your reform affects the economy (for example, the effect on poverty rates).

The _middle pane_ shows different things depending on what you’ve selected in the left pane. If you select a policy parameter, it’ll give you the option to change that parameter. If you select an output, it’ll show you a chart and some explanation.

The _right pane_ lets you control your policy reform at a high level: giving it a name, selecting where and when to simulate it, and against what baseline. You can also use this pane to move on from this screen and see how a specific household fares under a reform.

We want to build a reform that makes the CTC fully refundable: first, we need to select the right parameter. The left pane organises parameters by government department, so we could find it by navigating into _IRS > Credits > Child Tax Credit > Refundability_.

But a faster way is to use the search bar in the top-left to jump straight to it. Search for _Fully refundable CTC_ and you’ll see the parameter deciding whether the CTC should be fully refundable or not.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2844/0*E-av1hWDz0pqPrgH)

_Searching for the fully refundable CTC parameter._

We’ll select this parameter. The middle screen now shows that parameter: its title, description, and a graph of its value over time. This is one of the most powerful new features in PolicyEngine: the ability to specify a time-dated parametric reform to _any_ degree of complexity. Instead of just being able to set a parameter’s value for the current year, you can set it for any time period, as many times as you’d like using the start-end date dialogue.

For now though, we’ll just set it to true by clicking on the switch.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*_vw5TE6Ee77qhYcI)

_Making the CTC fully refundable._

You’ll notice the right sidebar has updated with a description of our reform, and it’s been auto-designated the name _Policy #5_. Let’s rename it to _Making the CTC fully refundable_ by typing that into the name displayed in the top-right.

Now, we’re ready to see the economic analysis. Click on _Calculate economic impact_ to see how it affects the US in 2023.

## Scoring the economic impact

The middle pane now shows a menu of what the model can tell you: the effect on the budget, poverty impacts, distributional impacts and more. Navigating onto the budgetary impact chart, we can see that this reform costs £2bn.

We can also look at the distributional impact, for example by selecting _Outcomes by income decile_. This reform mainly affects households in the top half of the income distribution, and the top decile sees the highest proportion of people affected by the reform.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*XWRXPEI2SbcQxmRN)

_Distributional analysis of making the CTC fully refundable._

## Calculating a household’s impact

Economic analyses are important for understanding the broader picture of a reform over an entire country, but policy discussions often centre around specific examples or edge cases. We’ve streamlined the design of the household calculator on PolicyEngine to make it easier and faster to get the numbers out of the model.

Select _Enter my household_ to jump into the household analysis page. This will take you to the household page (like you would have seen if you had selected _Compute household impacts_ at the very start, but now with your policy saved).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*x3qORoKzds5BP2s7)

_The household calculator’s landing page._

This screen is set out just like the policy screen: the left pane is for navigation, and is split between inputs and outputs. The middle pane lets you change household properties instead of policy parameters, and the right pane now will show details about your household once you’ve entered them.

The household screen will now give you an option to start entering details about your household. Click through, and use the prompts given to specify a few basic details: adults and children, location, income and age (you’ll be able to add more later).

Once you’ve entered these, you’ll be taken straight to the _Net income_ page, which tells you how your household is affected by the reform.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*7e4eDhkrqdHUeMHb)

_The net income screen._

This screen can tell us exactly why the household is affected like this: expand individual sections to trace down where the change comes from.

Another major new feature comes under the _Varying your earnings_ option in the bottom left pane: the ability to see how specific properties of a household change in response to earnings, not just net income. Here, we can use it to see how net federal income tax changed by income, with and without the reform.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*kcL3FBhilVYAFuJh)

_Federal income tax by income, under the abolition reform._

We can also see the impact on marginal tax rates: for a household with $20,000 income, making the CTC fully refundable raises their MTR from 23% to 38%.

From here, you can go back and change any input variable (by the left navigation menu, or with the search box in the top left), go back and change the policy reform, or revisit any other part of the app.

Let us know what policy ideas you create, by tagging @ThePolicyEngine.

Description: We're exiting beta with the most accessible tax and benefit model ever built.

---

At PolicyEngine, we strive to make tax and benefit policy accessible to everyone. That’s why we’ve not only built an open source rules engine for researchers, but also a free, intuitive web app where anyone can explore policies and customizable reforms.

Today we’re launching a new version of our web app that makes public policy more transparent and interactive than ever before. Our new app makes it easier to find the specific information you’re looking for, whether that’s navigating your household through taxes and benefits under current law, understanding how a policy reform could affect you, or designing a new policy. We’ve also added new functionality to increase the customizability, analytics, and shareability.

<center>[Interactive: 8lpXRppeq_U]</center>

If you’ve used the beta app, we think you’ll find the new version easier to use, and especially more delightful on mobile. We’ve also added a number of concrete new features, including:

- **Access to all household variables and policy parameters** in our model — several hundred in total — with a search box to cut down on clicks.

- **Named policies** that feed into chart titles.

- **Simplified household questionnaire** so you can estimate your taxes and benefits fast.

- **Deep linking to specific households, policies, and charts** for more reliable sharing.

- **Auto-generated code** to reproduce results with our open source Python package.

- **Cliff impact**, estimating how a reform affects the population share for whom an earnings increase would lower net income (more on that in a future post soon).

# How would reforms affect cliffs?
Slug: how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs
Date: 2023-02-02 21:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Nikhil Woodruff
Tags: us, policy
Description: We've added a new feature to the US version of PolicyEngine that lets you see how your reforms affect cliffs.

---

_We’re grateful to [Innovation Network for Communities](https://in4c.net/), which funded the development of this PolicyEngine feature and report._

## Overview

The _cliff_ (a.k.a. _benefit cliff_ or _welfare cliff_) is a phenomenon that occurs when an individual is worse off when their income rises, due to the government withdrawing benefits and/or levying taxes. Cliffs discourage individuals from working more hours or seeking a higher wage, and they have been a topic of concern in the US policy arena.

PolicyEngine now shows how policy reforms can avoid these cliffs. Our free and open source web app uses a comprehensive microsimulation model to compute the effects of customizable tax and benefit reforms on society and individual households.

With the [launch of the new PolicyEngine interface](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/the-new-policyengine), we have added two new measures that can be used to assess the prevalence and severity of cliffs under a given policy regime. These measures allow analysts to easily summarize the effects of custom reforms on cliffs across society.

This post examines the impact of current policy on the creation of cliffs at the household and population levels. The post also discusses how we measure the prevalence and severity of cliffs and presents a series of three policy experiments designed to reduce their occurrence. These experiments can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different reform measures and help the policy community develop more effective strategies for addressing cliffs.

## How current law creates cliffs

Users can enter their household information at [policyengine.org/us/household](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household) to compute their net income after taxes and benefits under current law. For example, below (left) is the result for a [single parent of a blind child in New York with $20,000 wages](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=1411) (users can expand or collapse elements).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ea-iCNObVVa3blyM)

Users can also view a chart of their [net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=1411) (after taxes and benefits) with respect to their earnings (above, center). We shade the earnings region where they would be worse off due to cliffs: we informally call this the “earnings dead zone”.

We also express cliffs as spikes in the [marginal tax rate chart](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=1411) (above, right).

## How reforms affect cliffs for individual households

PolicyEngine US lets users adjust hundreds of policy parameters governing federal and state tax and benefit programs. For example, [this page](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=12&focus=gov.ssa.ssi.income.exclusions.earned_share&region=us&timePeriod=2022&baseline=2) shows a policy experiment we consider in more detail below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*xRJCp7bnW-lab73G)

After specifying a policy reform, the net income and marginal tax rate charts show two lines each: one for baseline (gray), and one for reform (blue). The net income chart also shows two sets of earnings dead zones in different shadings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*s39iTSIqO-BaRzWP)

For this single parent of a blind child in New York, the SSI reform would not affect their net income or marginal tax rate at their current $20,000 earnings. But as they earn more, the reform would increase their SSI and phase it out over a longer earnings range. As a result, their marginal tax rate falls, and then rises once they reach an earnings level where it would have otherwise fully phased out.

In addition to changing marginal tax rates, the SSI reform would push the cliff from around $44,000 earnings to about $88,000 earnings. The cliff results from SNAP, for which SSI provides categorical eligibility.

This example shows that even at the individual level, even simple reforms can affect cliffs in multiple ways. For example, since this SSI reform removes cliffs for some households and creates them for others, how can we determine the net effect? To answer this question, we need a population-level perspective.

## How reforms affect cliffs in aggregate

We have added the following measures and charts:

- **Cliff rate:**
  Share of households who would be worse off if each adult earned $2,000 more per year

- **Cliff gap:**
  Total net income lost by households when adults earn an additional $2,000

We selected a $2,000 increment to capture plausible margins for labor supply decisions: $2,000 is roughly a $1 per hour raise for full-time workers, or one hour per workday at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Tax analysis often applies a smaller increment, such as $1, but this will only capture cliffs in hypothetical charts, not sparser microdata. The Department of Health and Human Services’s Marginal Tax Rate series measures cliffs with $2,000 increments. See Appendix A for exploration of other increments and approaches.

We use the _cliff_ nomenclature because both tax and benefit programs can create cliffs, and sometimes they interact to create cliffs that wouldn’t appear in the tax or benefit system alone. The _cliff rate_ and _cliff gap_ terms mirror the established _poverty rate_ (share of people below the poverty line) and _poverty gap_ (total amount below the poverty line across all people in poverty) terms.

Currently, we estimate that 0.5% of households face a cliff in 2023, producing a total cliff gap of $5.0 billion. In 2022, 1.7% of households faced a cliff, producing a cliff gap of $18.5 billion. The repeal of SNAP emergency allotments, scheduled for March 2023, reduces the prevalence of cliffs in 2023, as we discuss more below.

## Experiment 1: [Increase the SSI earned income exclusion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&household=1411&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=3183)

We can now answer the question we previously posed: given our SSI reform creates some cliffs and removes others, how does it affect total cliffs?

As some background, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a cash assistance program for low-income seniors and people with disabilities administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). For eligible people, the SSA calculates SSI as the difference between a maximum benefit and “countable income”. Above flat thresholds, each dollar of earned income is counted as 50 cents of countable income, meaning it creates a 50% marginal tax rate in the phase-out range.

Increasing the earned income exclusion to 75% effectively reduces SSI’s MTR to 25%. While this would not affect the cliff rate, it would reduce the cliff gap by 0.5%.

See Appendix B for caveats around PolicyEngine’s SSI microsimulation model.

## Experiment 2: [Repeal SNAP emergency allotments](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=3335&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Throughout the pandemic, several states have expanded the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) to provide the maximum benefit to eligible households, or an increase of at least $95 per month. While SNAP normally has a cliff due to a minimum allotment ($23 per month in 2023), the emergency allotments significantly expanded the cliff by effectively increasing the minimum allotment to the maximum allotment.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 repealed the SNAP emergency allotments, effective March 2023. We have modeled that ([see our process here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-23-updating-policyengine-to-reflect-snap-reform-in-the-omnibus-bill)), making the annual emergency allotments only a sixth as generous as they were in 2022, in the 34 states and DC where they remain in place.

Repealing the SNAP emergency allotments for January and February 2023 would cut the cliff rate by 34%, from 0.5% to 0.3%, and reduce the cliff gap 14.9%, from $5.0 billion to $4.3 billion.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2436/0*MScerJywMqvSjAWJ)

In 2022, when states provided SNAP emergency allotments throughout the year, they had a larger impact on cliffs. Repealing emergency allotments would have cut the cliff rate 91%, from 1.7% to 0.2%, and cut the cliff gap 94%, from $18.5 billion to $1.1 billion.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*BWzaOy8sULhqP-X3)

## Experiment 3: [Start phasing out Washington’s Working Families Tax Credit at a lower income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=3337&region=wa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Washington’s provides a refundable Working Families Tax Credit, with the amount and structure depending on household size. It starts phasing out at an amount below the end of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit: $2,500 below for families with one child, and $5,000 below for those with multiple children. This creates [marginal tax rates ranging from 12% to 24%](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us//gov/states/wa/tax/income/credits/working-families-tax-credit.html).

Phasing out the credit over a longer interval would increase MTRs for those newly in the phase-out region, and reduce MTRs for those already with earnings in the phase-out region. On a net basis, PolicyEngine finds that enlarging the phase-out region to $10,000 would have no effect on Washington’s cliff rate; however, it would lower Washington’s cliff gap by 0.4%, from $186.0 million to $185.2 million.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*NiYobhSg_1kDdWZR)

## Summary and future research

Government agencies and nonprofits have expanded their research into cliffs in recent years, as we summarize in Appendix C. We now provide a novel contribution to the cliff conversation: quantitative estimates of their prevalence under highly customizable reforms, alongside budgetary and distributional outcomes.

![Impacts of selected reforms on cliffs and other outcomes](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2756/1*sphHryjtjLOBIRJcX30xvg.png)_Impacts of selected reforms on cliffs and other outcomes_

However, our cliff measures are only as complete as our microsimulation model. Since we do not yet capture all tax and benefit programs (for example, childcare subsidies, housing subsidies, and state income taxes in most states), we under-report cliffs. Our [data enhancement plan](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) will also improve cliff modeling, especially at the state level where we rely on a small sample of households potentially subject to cliffs. As we improve our model, PolicyEngine will identify more cliffs — and more opportunities to address them.

Our policy experiments show that cliffs can be averted by making programs either more generous (increasing the SSI earned income exclusion) or less generous (repealing SNAP emergency allotments and phasing out Washington’s Working Families Tax Credit at lower incomes). In these instances, though, reforming programs with explicit cliffs had a much larger impact on cliff prevalence than reforming marginal tax rates.

As the policy community crafts policies to achieve other goals, such as budgetary constraints or poverty alleviation, they now have the tools to consider the incentive issues around cliffs as well.

## Appendix A: Alternative cliff definitions

We considered two dimensions of alternatives for cliffs:

- Earnings increment

- Grouping of people and households

We initially proposed reporting the share of adults whose net income would fall with an additional $2,000 of earnings. Further investigation revealed that reporting the share of adults would add to the PolicyEngine runtime by multiple times, since we would have to recompute a household’s net income under each adult’s increment independently. Instead, we chose to determine cliffs at the household level upon each adult increasing their earnings simultaneously.

The increment affects the resolution of the cliffs. If the increment is too low, too few households will be just below the cliff in order to experience it. If the increment is too high, it won’t capture smaller cliffs, as households will earn enough to get out of them.

While we did not intend to select a threshold as to maximize cliffs and gaps, we consulted the evidence to decide whether to stray from our original plan. Since cliffs in 2022 peaked at increments around $2,000-$3,000, we kept our original $2,000 increment.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3156/0*vMeICnyMyfSe4f9_)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3108/0*r7SK9ZwRhPeL7mf8)

We also considered whether to “pool” the earnings increment, i.e. to divide it across all adults in the household rather than increase each adult’s by that amount. This approach pushes the peak cliff rates and gaps to $6,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/0*MEK7DtIlWNLOkJ9G)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2988/0*BFO-3rIyT4OP_Q72)

Since pooling the earnings increment adds complexity without producing an obvious benefit, we opted not to pool them.

_These numbers differ slightly from the current baseline cliff values for 2022, as we produced them with an earlier version of the model._

## Appendix B: PolicyEngine’s SSI microsimulation model

The Social Security Administration determines eligibility for SSI based on four factors:

- Age

- Disability

- Income

- Assets

PolicyEngine uses the Current Population Survey for microsimulation modeling. Of these factors, the CPS only has reliable information on age and income. CPS respondents report difficulties across six areas, including vision, and they do not report assets.

Modeling SSI in reforms requires assigning eligibility independent of whether a respondent reported receiving SSI. For example, if a reform increases income eligibility limits (as in _Experiment 1_ here), we need to estimate whether a respondent would be newly eligible.

We assign SSI eligibility stochastically using the following algorithm:

1. Assign blindness to respondents who report vision difficulty in the CPS.

1. Assign disability to respondents who report any difficulty in the CPS.

1. Calculate the share of the ABD (aged, blind, or disabled) population that would meet other SSI requirements except for income, such as asset limits and disability certification, as well as take-up conditional on eligibility, in order to match the SSA’s total SSI enrollment records.
   _We estimate that **59%** of the ABD population would participate in SSI based on non-income-based eligibility requirements and take-up._

1. Assign SSI eligibility randomly to 59% of the ABD population.

# The Child Tax Credit in 2023
Slug: the-child-tax-credit-in-2023

_Credit: DALL-E 2_

In Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, President Joe Biden called to expand the Child Tax Credit. What is the Child Tax Credit, how might it affect you, and what impact does PolicyEngine estimate it has on society? This blog post covers the bases.

## What is the Child Tax Credit?

The Clinton administration introduced the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in 1997 as a partially refundable credit. That is, some tax filers, including those with no federal tax liability, could claim a portion of the credit. The refundable portion of the credit, known as the Additional Child Tax Credit, phased in with income. The full credit value reduced tax liability towards zero, but higher-income earners phased out of the credit.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expanded the CTC by:

1. Doubling the maximum credit amount to $2,000 per child

1. Increasing the refundable portion

1. Extending the phase-out threshold

1. Limiting the credit for children and dependents without Social Security numbers

The Joint Committee on Taxation [estimated](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2017/jcx-67-17/) that these reforms cost $544 billion from 2018 to 2027, or 37% of the $1.5 trillion net cost of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act over that period.

For the 2021 tax year only, the American Rescue Plan Act further expanded the CTC in several ways. ARPA:

1. Extended eligibility to 17-year-olds

1. Raised the maximum amount from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17; this higher amount is available to parents with income below $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married)

1. Made the credit fully refundable

1. Prepaid half the expected 2021 credit on a monthly basis, beginning in July 2021

Other than ARPA, the CTC structure has not changed since 2018, aside from some parameters increasing with inflation (though the law fixes the maximum credit value at $2,000).

## How does the Child Tax Credit affect individual households?

We can compute the impact of the Child Tax Credit in PolicyEngine by first [abolishing the Child Tax Credit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.abolitions.ctc&reform=3318&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318), and then swapping the baseline and reform. This tells us the impact of introducing the CTC compared to a baseline where it doesn’t exist, and we can use it for both individual and society-wide analysis.

Consider a [married filer with one child and $250,000 wages](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) in 2023. They would receive the full $2,000 CTC.

If we [vary their earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), we can see how the partial refundability effectively phases the CTC in with income, and how it phases out with income as well.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2836/0*KLgJ76doY6WE95Lt)

Correspondingly, the [CTC lowers this filer’s marginal tax rates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) in the phase-in earnings region, and raises marginal tax rates in the phase-out region.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*MYcUq_rSgMsHu1o9)

To see how the Child Tax Credit affects your own finances and work incentives, [enter your own household information](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&reform=2) and PolicyEngine will produce these personalized analytics.

## How does the Child Tax Credit impact society?

We can compute the impact of the Child Tax Credit in PolicyEngine by first abolishing the Child Tax Credit, and then swapping the baseline and reform. This tells us the impact of introducing the CTC compared to a baseline where it doesn’t exist. I showed how to design it below, but you can skip to the impact [here](http://localhost:3000/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318).

In 2023, we estimate that the [Child Tax Credit costs $109.9 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318). As context, the Tax Policy Center estimated in September 2021 that the CTC would cost [$126.3 billion in calendar year 2023](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/tax-benefits-child-tax-credit-september-2021/t21-0223-tax-expenditure-child-tax).

Among the bottom 90% of households, the [CTC increases with income on average](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), due both to the partial refundability and higher income households having more children. The top income decile has a lower benefit as the credit phases out for high income filers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*EOZKSyWudaW5avqG)

[As a percentage of net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), the Child Tax Credit has the largest benefit for the fourth income decile.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*0zeQPrJ9p_mki-gM)

[45% of Americans benefit from the Child Tax Credit.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) For 30% of the population, the CTC increases household net income by at least 5%, disproportionately those in the fourth through sixth income deciles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*wEG9Brxqq8ITG327)

[Without the Child Tax Credit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), we estimate that the poverty rate would be 14.4% rather than 14.1%, and that the child poverty rate would be 9.6% instead of 8.9%. That is, we project that the current CTC cuts poverty 2.1% and child poverty 6.9%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*WWSTQpJ4f_zu8eMh)

The [CTC reduces the deep poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) — the population share with income below half their Supplemental Poverty Measure threshold — by less than 0.1%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*IW-FLe4tzpb46cbn)

The [CTC also reduces income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) using our three measures, for example cutting the Gini index by 1.1%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*6H6JJlR5ouBqY3-c)

The [CTC reduces the prevalence and severity of cliffs by 1.0% and 0.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), respectively. Cliffs occur when people who earn more have a lower net income due to taxes and withdrawn benefits. The CTC’s partial refundability lowers marginal tax rates, while its phase-out increases marginal tax rates; since low-income families disproportionately face cliffs, the marginal tax rate reductions at the low end reduce cliffs. [Read our full explainer on cliffs here.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs-c390fffcfdf7)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*dfD9j_Hng5cTIAQH)

You can view these analytics for any US state using the drop-down menu in the right panel. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Child Tax Credit [provides an aggregate $3.8 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318) in benefits, [reduces child poverty 6.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318), and [lowers the Gini index by 1.0%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318).

In conclusion, PolicyEngine provides a variety of analytics on the Child Tax Credit (CTC). Individuals can navigate the partially-refundable structure to estimate how it affects them, and explore different earnings scenarios. Those interested in broader effects can view our estimates of the CTC’s cost and distributional impacts, such as the degree to which it reduces poverty, inequality, and cliffs across the US and individual states. As policymakers explore CTC reforms, and households continue to seek information on it, we will continue to provide personalized and [increasingly accurate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) analytics on the policy’s impact.

# Restoration of the American Rescue Plan Act's expanded Child Tax Credit

In [Tuesday’s State of the Union speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/), President Joe Biden called to

> restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.

Biden may have been referring to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which expanded the CTC in several ways. Following our [Child Tax Credit report released yesterday](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), this report describes ARPA’s CTC expansion, and PolicyEngine’s predicted impacts of restoring that expansion.

## What is the Child Tax Credit?

President Bill Clinton introduced the Child Tax Credit in 1997, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 expanded it to create its current structure. For instance, in 2023, a married filer with one five-year-old child receives the following benefit from the CTC based on their earnings ([view this in PolicyEngine here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962)):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2836/0*8VNzHFmDkAEmKVAp)

As we explain in our [Child Tax Credit article](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), the credit phases in with income due to _partial refundability_ and also phases out with income. Refundable credits can reduce one’s tax liability below zero, while the value of non-refundable credits cannot exceed one’s tax liability. Part of the Child Tax Credit, the _Additional Child Tax Credit_, is refundable, and the ACTC also phases in with income; the remainder is non-refundable.

## How did the American Rescue Plan Act expand the Child Tax Credit?

For the 2021 tax year only, the American Rescue Plan Act made four major changes to the CTC:

1. Extended eligibility to 17-year-olds

1. Raised the maximum amount from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17; this bonus phases out for parents with income exceeding $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married)

1. Made the credit fully refundable

1. Prepaid half the expected 2021 credit on a monthly basis, beginning in July 2021

This video shows how to model these changes in PolicyEngine. To see the results, skip to the next section, where the links reflect the pre-built policy.

<center>[Interactive: _PcdbIIQ6AM]</center>

## How would restoring the ARPA CTC expansion affect households?

[Let’s return to the married family with a five-year-old child.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=3227) Their maximum credit rises from $2,000 to $3,600. Parents with no income don’t benefit from the CTC today, so the combination of the increased credit and full refundability provides them the full $3,600. The benefit phases out to $1,600 if their income ranges from about $36,000 to $150,000, and the reform no longer provides a net benefit to households with income of about $181,000 or more.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2104/0*kx4Lg-oIr5BXyvTm)

[Marginal tax rates rise](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=3227) in each of the income ranges where the benefit phases out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2136/0*pmjjChx83tq1Hfu0)

You can estimate how reinstating the ARPA CTC expansion would affect your own household by [entering your information here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

## How would restoring the ARPA CTC expansion affect the US?

We estimate that [restoring the ARPA CTC expansion would cost $100.2 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) in 2023. When scoring ARPA (2021 only), the Joint Committee on Taxation [estimate](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2021/jcx-14-21/)d a cost of [$109.5 billion](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2021/jcx-14-21/). [OpenRG estimated $100.7 billion](https://www.openrg.com/reports/QN_ARPA_Distribution.pdf) using the open source Tax-Calculator model (I coauthored this analysis).

While the ARPA CTC expansion provides greater benefits to low-income families than higher-income families, it [provides less to low-income households](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) than middle-income households because they have fewer children. The program also provides high-income families less because of the phase-out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2664/0*qAUaf1GWBDmMtf1L)

As a percentage of net income, however, restoring the ARPA CTC would strictly [provide greater benefits to lower income deciles](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2764/0*YCCpCYPTm7MQoMW6)

Restoring the ARPA CTC would [benefit households comprising 41% of Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately those in the fourth through eighth income deciles ([the current CTC benefits 45% of Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023)). It would raise net income by at least 5% for 27% of Americans, disproportionately those in the fourth and fifth income deciles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2696/0*Mmbr7KNvXN9YLM79)

[Poverty would fall by 9%, and child poverty would fall 37%.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) When evaluating the ARPA CTC’s impact on child poverty in 2021, the [Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Analysis-of-the-Romney-Child-Allowance_final.pdf) and the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Tax-Benefits-of-Parenthood.pdf#page=22) projected reductions of 39% and 35%, respectively.

In the State of the Union, President Biden said that the “full Child Tax Credit…cut child poverty in half”. He may have been referring to the full ARPA, which also included a round of relief checks, enhancements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and other reforms. The Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimated that [ARPA would reduce child poverty by 56%](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/6113eddb3cde100cb68904ee/1628696027691/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-American-Rescue-Plan-CPSP-2021.pdf). The Census Bureau reported that [child poverty fell 46% from 2020 to 2021](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf#page=16), from 9.7% to 5.2%.

Halving child poverty with the ARPA CTC structure would require a [$4,400 benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=3840&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=2265), rather than $3,000 or $3,600. This would cost $177 billion, 77% more than restoring the ARPA CTC expansion.

Under the ARPA CTC expansion, deep poverty — the population share below half their Supplemental Poverty Measure threshold — would [fall 11%, and deep child poverty would fall 72%.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2736/0*By0I0_qhekKlxkIv)

Restoring the ARPA CTC would [reduce each of the three income inequality measures we report](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), especially the Gini index at 1.9%. The Gini index reflects low-income households more than the top 10% and 1% income shares do, and these are the groups disproportionately affected by the ARPA CTC expansion.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2716/0*Lvup1GU6M0wxFGzN)

By increasing marginal tax rates among low-income households most likely to experience [cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-02-how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs), the [ARPA CTC expansion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) increases their prevalence. The [current CTC](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023) reduces marginal tax rates in the phase-in earnings region, and lowers the cliff rate and gap by 1.0% and 0.6%, almost exactly an offset of the ARPA reform.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2284/0*o6ZxOJ5izxBcLASn)

Were the US to restore the American Rescue Plan’s expanded Child Tax Credit, two in five Americans would benefit, poverty would fall 9%, and a broad measure of inequality would fall 2%. PolicyEngine also computes impacts for any state; for example, the ARPA CTC would [provide $10 billion to Texans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (the cost to the US), [benefit 46% of Texans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and [cut Texas’s child poverty rate by 32%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). These impacts, as well as the $100 billion cost and higher marginal tax rates, would likely produce macroeconomic effects that PolicyEngine does not yet model.

With PolicyEngine, you can model highly customizable reforms to the Child Tax Credit and other programs — not only those enacted in the past like the American Rescue Plan Act. Try your own policy model at [policyengine.org](http://legacy.policyengine.org).

Description: PolicyEngine estimates the distributional impact of two provisions and the household impact of four provisions.

---

**_[See how the proposal would affect your household.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)_**

On Monday, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey introduced her [fiscal year 2024 budget recommendation](https://www.mass.gov/doc/fy-2024-budget-recommendation-brief-providing-meaningful-tax-relief), which included five main proposals:

1. Replacing the existing dependent and dependent care credits with a Child & Family Credit of $600 per qualifying dependent

2. Reducing estate taxes

3. Increasing the cap on the renter’s tax deduction from $3,000 to $4,000

4. Doubling the maximum Senior Circuit Breaker Credit

5. Reducing the rate on short term capital gains from 12% to 5%

PolicyEngine models the personal income tax code of Massachusetts, including each of the provisions Healey seeks to modify, except the estate tax. Our microsimulation model also supports population-wide impacts of two of the provisions: the Child & Family Credit and the capital gains reform. PolicyEngine estimates that these two provisions would together benefit 38% of the Massachusetts population and reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.2%. Our cost projections fall 15% below the state’s, though we can attribute at least some of this divergence to inaccuracies in the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.

This post describes these provisions, examines the impact on three hypothetical households, and shows our microsimulation model’s distributional impacts for the available provisions.

## Governor Healey’s Budget Recommendation

[A report from John Caljouw](https://www.mass.gov/doc/fy-2024-budget-recommendation-brief-providing-meaningful-tax-relief/download), the Massachusetts Finance Director, describes and costs the core provisions of Governor Healey’s proposal.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2844/0*UhP_0DIrLTDke_Ia)

Here we detail each provision.

## Child & Family Credit

**_[See the impact of the Child & Family Credit on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5843&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [on Massachusetts](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5843&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)._**

Currently, Massachusetts families can claim one of the following two refundable tax credits:

1. **Dependent Tax Credit,** which provides $180 to children up to age 11

1. **Dependent Care Tax Credit,** which provides up to $240 per child, also up to two children, up to age 12 and phasing in with the lesser of the filer head and spouse’s earnings (similar to the federal Child and Dependent Care Credit)

[As she did in her gubernatorial campaign last year](https://maurahealey.com/issues/child-tax-credit/), Governor Healey proposes to replace these with a Child & Family Credit of $600 per qualifying dependent. The Child & Family Tax Credit is structured as the Dependent Tax Credit, except that it increases the amount from $180 to $600, increases the age limit from 11 to 12, and removes the child cap.

## Estate tax

Governor Healey proposes eliminating any Estate Taxes for estates with a value of less than $3,000,000 and providing a non-refundable Estate Tax credit of up to $182,000 for estates valued above $3,000,000. PolicyEngine does not model estate taxes.

## Renter tax deduction increase

[**_See the impact of the renter tax deduction increase on your household._**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5370&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Massachusetts provides a tax deduction of up to 50% of filers’ yearly rent, capped at $3,000. Governor Healey proposes raising this to $4,000.

## Senior Circuit Breaker Credit increase

[**_See the impact of the Senior Circuit Breaker Credit increase on your household._**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5828&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Massachusetts provides a Senior Circuit Breaker Tax Credit, which reduces tax liabilities for filers aged 65 or older, depending on their income, rent, and property tax, in particular when rent and property tax exceed 10% of one’s income. Governor Healey proposes doubling the maximum credit from $1,200 to $2,400.

## Short-term capital gains cut

**_[See the impact of the short-term capital gains cut on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [on Massachusetts](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)._**

Massachusetts currently taxes most income at 5%, except income exceeding $1 million (9%) and short term capital gains (12%). The federal government and two other states also tax capital gains differently depending on whether the assets have been held for a year. Governor Healey proposes equalizing short and long term capital gains rates by reducing the short term rate from 12% to 5%.

## Household examples

To illustrate the impact of the four policies, we show how they would affect three hypothetical households: a family of four with childcare expenses, single renter with short-term capital gains, and senior homeowning couple. In each case, we show the impact to net income and marginal tax rates as the household head’s earnings vary.

## Family of five with childcare expenses

Consider this family of five:

- Spouse earns $20,000 per year, one infant, one six-year-old child, and one ten-year-old child

- Renting in Norfolk County, and paying [$3,600 per month](https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/ma/?bedrooms=3), Zillow’s estimated median for three-bedroom homes in Massachusetts

- Paying the median center-based infant care cost in Norfolk County, which the [US Department of Labor estimates](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/childcare/price-by-age-care-setting) at $26,409 per year in 2022 (the highest in Massachusetts)

- No childcare costs for the six- and ten-year-old children

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a net benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9150) if they earn above $8,000, and $50 if they earn at least $9,500. This is the earnings range over which they would pay income taxes, and where the renter tax deduction begins to reduce their taxable income.

Overall, this family would benefit mainly from the consolidation of the Dependent Credit and the Dependent Care Credit into the Family & Child Tax Credit. Current law entitles them to a maximum credit of $240 per child, up to a max of two children, giving them $480. Governor Healey’s proposal would make three of their children eligible for a $600 credit, [producing a total credit of $1,800](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9183). Compared to current law, Governor Healey’s proposed Renters Deduction increase would also reduce their [income tax liability by $50](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9183).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2988/0*OP5yHLdqVl6UEIKq)

## Single renter with short-term capital gains

Consider a single person paying $2,050 per month in rent, [Zillow’s estimated median](https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/ma/?bedrooms=0) for studios in Massachusetts.

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a net benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9109) if they earn above $8,000, and $50 if they earn at least $9,500. This is the earnings range over which they would pay income taxes, and where the renter tax deduction begins to reduce their taxable income.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2988/0*UhFSHuDxId6dchbM)

The reform [lowers their marginal tax rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9109) between $8,000 and $9,500 earnings by between zero and five percentage points. The [cuts to the short-term capital gain rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9216) are responsible for the majority of the benefit in this case, saving this individual $8,092.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2988/0*y1BvVcRcT2GzdAh1)

## Senior homeowning couple

Finally, consider a couple, each 70 years old and owning a home.

Each receives $21,348 per year in Social Security retirement benefits, the average according to the [Social Security Administration.](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/)

Their home is worth $545,865, [Zillow’s estimated median for the state,](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/26/ma/) and they pay a 1.12% property tax rate, [SmartAsset’s estimated average](https://smartasset.com/taxes/massachusetts-property-tax-calculator#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Massachusetts%20Taxes&text=The%20median%20annual%20property%20tax,the%20national%20average%20at%200.99%25.) for the state. That is, they pay $6,114 per year in property taxes.

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a $784 net gain if they have no earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9123), falling to zero if they earn at least $8,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2908/0*2krJxIELH3ov4klK)

This is the income range over which the reform raises the Senior Circuit Breaker Credit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3032/0*e7JwEFHk8Vj4uDeQ)

The reform increases the filer’s marginal tax rate by ten percentage points in this phase-out range.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2832/0*WdJEv_z7HgdyDK42)

## Impact on Massachusetts

PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model pairs our tax-benefit rules engine with the Current Population Survey to estimate the aggregate impact of policy reforms. As the CPS does not contain information about households’ rent, property taxes, or inheritance, we estimate only the impact of the Child & Family Credit and the capital gains reform.

## Budget

Compared to the Finance Director’s report, PolicyEngine projects lower costs of each provision: 11% lower for the Child & Family Credit and 35% lower for the capital gains cut. We will release a [more accurate version of the CPS](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) this year to address under-reporting of income and benefits.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2632/1*A_fXJDNYYLxJ2f61JzBjnA.png)

[The Child & Family Credit would reduce the Gini index](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5365&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) of income inequality by 0.2%, while the [capital gains cut would increase the Gini index](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) by less than 0.1%.

## Distributional impact

Together, the two provisions PolicyEngine models population impacts for — the Child & Family Credit and the short-term capital gains cut — would [increase the average household’s net income by $173](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately among higher income households.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3628/1*ViMykxuBpi5dmu2ekpTl7g.png)

These provisions would [raise the average household’s net income by 0.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately among lower income deciles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3604/1*pbN71nCWONDxm48BnCdkOw.png)

[38% of Massachusettsans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) live in households that would benefit from the two provisions. A larger share of higher-income households would gain, while a larger share of lower-income households would gain at least 5% of net income (dark green). The provisions do not leave any households worse off than baseline policy.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3644/1*mp0yQsc2_A5tTX3KDE39WA.png)

PolicyEngine projects [no poverty impact](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) of the Child & Family Credit and short-term capital gains cut, while deep poverty (the population share in households with resources below half their poverty line) would [fall 1.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

_PolicyEngine’s poverty impacts in small states are noisy, due to using a single year’s Current Population Survey._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3668/1*FxLPdCVJYlXYqVvBWmjSDw.png)

The two provisions would [reduce each measure of income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) we report.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3628/1*FN1z8kPnbj_pDk9Yi_pR5A.png)

While the reforms alter marginal tax rates, we do not project any [impact on cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). Like poverty estimates, cliffs are a dichotomous household outcome that can be noisy in small states.

## Conclusion

Governor Healey’s FY 2024 Budget Recommendation proposes several significant policy changes that would impact households in Massachusetts in diverse ways. PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model provides valuable insight into the potential impact of these proposals on different segments of the population. While further analysis may be required to fully understand the impact of these policies on the residents of Massachusetts, PolicyEngine’s ability to enable detailed analysis of policies is a valuable tool for policymakers in designing and evaluating policy proposals. As Massachusetts moves forward with its budget process, PolicyEngine’s analysis can provide valuable information to policymakers and support evidence-based decision-making.

# Breaking down poverty impacts by sex
Slug: breaking-down-us-poverty-impacts-by-sex
Date: 2023-03-08 07:30:00
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, technical
Description: PolicyEngine estimates the impact of customizable policy reforms on poverty — overall, by age, and now by sex.

---

Welcome to the latest blog post from PolicyEngine, where we share updates on our work to build free, open-source software that helps people understand the impact of public policies. We’re excited to announce an additional feature for our existing tax and benefit reform calculator that enables users to estimate how customizable tax and benefit reforms affect the poverty rate, split by sex.

Since our inception, we’ve shown how customizable policy reforms would affect the poverty rate, overall and by age group. We model impacts using the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which the Census Bureau [introduced in 2011](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45031) to expand upon the Official Poverty Measure (OPM), introduced in the 1960s. Unlike the OPM, the SPM considers taxes, in-kind benefits, local housing costs, and other factors.

We estimate that, under current law, 9.6% of the population has resources below their poverty threshold, and 3.3% has resources below half their poverty threshold (deep poverty). Women face higher poverty rates than men, and children face higher poverty rates than working-age adults, who face higher poverty rates than seniors. These poverty trends resemble those in the [Census Bureau’s 2021 poverty report](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf#page=11), though the exact numbers differ as we adjust survey data based on 2023 policy rules. Deep poverty does not vary much by sex, though working-age adults face higher rates than other age groups.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5232/1*jk1rnf2EF3DgnFNHr218DA.png)

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the power of our updated tool. Suppose we want to estimate the poverty impact of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides nutrition assistance to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. With PolicyEngine, anyone can compare today’s poverty rate to a scenario without WIC — overall, by age group, and now by sex.

We estimate that WIC reduces poverty by 0.8% and deep poverty by 2.2%. Our pre-existing charts show that WIC disproportionately benefits children, [reducing child poverty by 2.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6454) and [deep child poverty by 8.1%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6454).

Our new charts show that [WIC lowers poverty by 0.7% for men and 0.9% for women](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6454).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*BQvi2FCn2a6SXUho)

We also find that [WIC lowers deep poverty by 1.9% for men and 2.4% for women](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderDeepPovertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6454).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*o2Wxc1THrDYKjkxs)

Our updated tax and benefit reform calculator helps policymakers, researchers, and advocates better understand the impact of public policies on poverty rates, both overall and in deep poverty, for men and women. By providing policymakers with more accurate data on the impact of policy decisions, we can inform public discourse and facilitate evidence-based decision-making.

# How much should James Medlock donate to GiveDirectly?

[_Jump to the tool_](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/)

One week ago, Twitter user James Medlock tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll bet anyone $1 million dollars that the US does not enter hyperinflation</p>&mdash; James Medlock (@jdcmedlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1636480393007489024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The next day, entrepreneur and investor Balaji Srinivasan agreed by quote-tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will take that bet.<br>You buy 1 BTC.<br>I will send $1M USD.<br>This is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.<br>The term is 90 days.<br>All we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.<br>If someone knows how to do this… <a href="https://t.co/hhPr522PQu">https://t.co/hhPr522PQu</a> <a href="https://t.co/6Aav9KeJpe">pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe</a></p>&mdash; Balaji (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That is, Srinivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase, is betting that Bitcoin will exceed $1 million US dollars within 90 days.

This bet [appears to be moving forward](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1638611778006560768). When discussing how he’d use the potential winnings, Medlock tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes - my goal is to give myself a 70 effective tax rate between taxes and a GiveDirectly donation</p>&mdash; James Medlock (@jdcmedlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1637472476782362624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org) is a charity that gives unconditional cash transfers to low-income households. Medlock [plans to give an unrestricted grant](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1637848723052167168), which GiveDirectly currently directs to Africa.

Should Medlock win his bet, how much should he donate to GiveDirectly to fulfill his pledge? The interaction between charitable donations and tax liability means that answering this question requires a model of the tax code — like PolicyEngine’s.

Using [our `policyengine-us` Python package](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) — the same package that powers our web app — and the [Streamlit](http://streamlit.app) dashboarding software, [**we built a tool**](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) to calculate how much Medlock should give. The amount to give also depends on other circumstances of Medlock’s finances and household, and our tool includes levers to explore different scenarios.

We find that Medlock should give between $333,000 (if he has at least $4 million in other income) and $565,000 (if he has no other income).

## Who is James Medlock?

James Medlock ([@jdcmedlock](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock?lang=en)) is a pseudonymous Twitter account known for his social and economic policy content. Relevant information for his taxes include:

- [Lives in Oakland, California](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1358307871188865030)

- [Married](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1431664648701448195)

- [Doesn’t have children](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1484002980466626560) (though he previously cared for a cat, [Midnight](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1616950217391362048))

- [Self-employed](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1415412142535106560)

- [33 years old](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1368113815779385345) (his profile picture is a portrait of economic anthropologist [Karl Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi) as an older man)

## Using our calculator

[Our calculator](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) runs Medlock’s household through the `policyengine-us` Python package via the Streamlit dashboarding app. We consider the above characteristics, and then let users set employment and self-employment income for Medlock and his wife.

As an example, suppose Medlock earns $100,000 from self-employment, and his wife earns $100,000 from employment. We would enter this as so:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3012/0*GnNvsUqhT-LxtSpt)

[The main PolicyEngine app shows](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16581) that, between payroll tax, self-employment tax, federal income tax, and California income tax, they would pay $58,949 in taxes, leaving a net income of $141,051 (they would not be eligible for any benefits).[^1]

[^1]: California has not yet released its 2023 tax bracket thresholds, so we use values from 2022.

Now with $1 million in gambling winnings, their [tax bill will rise $436,115](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16582) from $58,949 to $495,064; federal income taxes rise from $26,967 to $361,051, California income taxes rise from $10,202 to $112,233, and payroll and self-employment taxes stay the same. Their net income rises by the remaining $563,886 to $704,937 if he doesn’t donate anything.

To take home $300,000, they might consider donating $700,000. But if they did so, their [taxes would rise $119,088](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16583), leaving them with only $300,000 — $119,088 = $180,912 net. How much less than $700,000 of a donation will offset the tax change?

Our app shows that, for Medlock’s net income to rise by $300,000, he should donate **$484,848**. [In this scenario](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16586), his taxes would rise $215,235. (This actually leaves him $299,917; we run an optimization process that gets within $100 or so to save time.)

We also show various donation scenarios as a table:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2940/0*PCSgFGaaV70lLv8P)

And as a Plotly chart:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*BG6ygtFTdgcXdm_a)

Calling the `policyengine-us` `Simulation` object with `axes` makes it easy and fast to simulate many scenarios like this. All in all, the app required 224 lines of Python code, including text and charts. See the full program at[ github.com/PolicyEngine/james-medlock-donation-solver](http://github.com/PolicyEngine/james-medlock-donation-solver/) and the app at [policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/).

## Conclusion

While most of our users interact with our software through the web app, our Python packages provide flexible analysis, especially paired with dashboarding tools like Streamlit. We’ll be watching the Medlock-Srinivasan bet, and building more tools to answer one-off questions outside our main app, including those around charitable giving. Stay tuned!

# FiscalSim and PolicyEngine: Emphasizing collaboration and open-source acknowledgment
Slug: fiscalsim
Date: 2023-03-24 01:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Nikhil Woodruff
Tags: us, technical
Description: The Center for Growth and Opportunity launches FiscalSim, a US policy-computing web app drawing heavily from PolicyEngine's work.

---

PolicyEngine, a nonprofit organization, has been dedicated to providing free, open-source software that computes the impact of public policy. Our mission has been to democratize the policy process by making it accessible for everyone, from experts to everyday citizens. To achieve this, we are committed to open-sourcing our models, apps, and reports, allowing anyone to freely use and scrutinize them. [PolicyEngine US](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us), our microsimulation model, is a collaborative project with contributions from over 40 volunteer developers.

Recently, we noticed the launch of [FiscalSim](http://fiscalsim.thecgo.org) by the [Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University (CGO)](http://thecgo.org). In this post, we reflect on its development, our contributions to the project, and our past collaboration with CGO.

## The launch of FiscalSim

FiscalSim, a project of the CGO, allows users to simulate the effects of policy experiments on individuals and the economy. While we appreciate the CGO’s efforts to create a tool that promotes transparency and accessibility in the policy-making process, we feel it’s important to acknowledge the foundational work done by PolicyEngine and our past collaboration with the CGO.

[FiscalSim’s FAQ](https://fiscalsim.thecgo.org/faq/) highlights the capabilities of its tax-benefit microsimulation model, FiscalSim US, and provides a link to its source code on GitHub. As explained in [their GitHub repo](http://github.com/thecgo/fiscalsim-us), “much of the original federal tax and benefit code and some of the state tax logic was developed by PolicyEngine.”

## FiscalSim US model

Currently, the only differences between the FiscalSim US model and PolicyEngine US are the name and the inclusion of Utah’s state income tax policy. Of the policies listed in [their FAQ](https://fiscalsim.thecgo.org/faq/), all but the state income tax and state tax credits (and of those, only Utah) were implemented by PolicyEngine.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2636/0*62EpTM4TErJ8l9bG)

Indeed, of all line changes in the FiscalSim US repo, 99% come from five [pull requests](https://github.com/TheCGO/fiscalsim-us/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) that solely add our updates to their code. The CGO made these pull requests while the repo was private, and a [comment](https://web.archive.org/web/20230324190736/https://github.com/TheCGO/fiscalsim-us/pull/27#issuecomment-1453095703) in one of them suggests that the mechanism to copy our code lies in their fiscalsim-us-maintenance repo, which [remains private](http://github.com/thecgo/fiscalsim-us-maintenance).

We have always made PolicyEngine’s code entirely open source.

## FiscalSim interface

The CGO based FiscalSim’s interface largely on PolicyEngine’s original design, which we used from [March 2022](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-03-31-policyengine-comes-stateside) to [January 2023](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/the-new-policyengine). Unlike our open source interface, FiscalSim is closed-source, so we cannot determine how much code traces to our work. But the visual similarities are evident.

Consider these screenshots from our [Washington state launch](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-08-10-policyengine-launches-in-washington-state), covering the four core screens of the app: household definition, policy reform, household impact, and population impact.

The household screen resembles our original app, with sections of inputs on the left, inputs in the center, page navigation at the top (though they move some navigation to the far left), and reforms on the right. Because the content and organization of the variables follows from the model, those also match.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2744/0*wVbrT7kMusj7SZd7)

Similarly, FiscalSim’s parameter design mirrors ours.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*8Du2q8bZ9XZIgfMr)

The household net income screen breaks down income the same way (our video didn’t include a policy reform on this screen, but it had the same format and content as FiscalSim does).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*JOpdYNHh5Q-Ui42c)

The population impact screen also contains the same summaries and charts as our original version did.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*S_WY5xxmUgcjYRzt)

Each of the four main sections of the FiscalSim app — household definition, policy reform, household impact, and population impact — draw heavily from our design, and the 99%-similar model code further highlights the resemblances.

## Collaboration with the CGO

About a year ago, the CGO funded PolicyEngine’s development of state income taxes in three states: Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington. We sought to support their research through continued development, but they opted to build a separate app instead.

We have credited the CGO’s financial contribution on [GitHub](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) and [our blog](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-08-10-policyengine-launches-in-washington-state), and we would do the same if we incorporate CGO code (like the Utah income tax) into PolicyEngine. But that contribution now represents a small part of our software, which also includes seven other state income tax models, all federal taxes and major benefit programs, microdata processing, the policyengine-core framework, impact summaries, and the front-end, all of which is the product of over 40 (mostly volunteer) contributors.

## Acknowledging collaborative efforts

We understand that the development of software often involves collaboration and building upon existing frameworks. In the spirit of open-source development, we encourage the sharing and improvement of tools that contribute to better policy outcomes. However, we believe it’s essential to give credit where it’s due and acknowledge the collaborative efforts that have led to the creation of such tools. For instance, we credited the [Policy Simulation Library](http://pslmodels.org) and [SNAP Screener](https://www.snapscreener.com/?p=table) for their helpful transparency in [our US launch](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-03-31-policyengine-comes-stateside), and [OpenFisca](http://openfisca.org) when we [forked it](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-11-10-from-openfisca-to-policyengine) into our own microsimulation framework.

## Moving forward

As we move forward, PolicyEngine remains committed to advancing open-source policy modeling tools and fostering collaboration within the community. We encourage the sharing and improvement of tools that contribute to better policy outcomes and believe it’s essential to give credit where it’s due.

We hope that future collaborations between PolicyEngine and other organizations, like the CGO, will result in mutual recognition and an open dialogue that benefits the policy-making community as a whole. As the landscape of policy modeling tools continues to evolve, it is crucial for organizations to work together to advance transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By working together, we can contribute to the ongoing development of accessible, transparent, and effective policy-making solutions.

# Restoring the American Rescue Plan's Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion
Slug: restoring-arpa-eitc
Date: 2023-03-27 01:00:00
Authors: Arthur Wright
Tags: us, policy
Description: We review how the expansion works and model its impact with PolicyEngine US.

---

Earlier this month, the Biden Administration [announced its budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/09/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2024/) for the 2024 fiscal year. The proposal “calls on the Congress to make the Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for childless workers permanent, which would help pull low-paid workers out of poverty.”

The president’s announcement refers to the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) temporarily enacted by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in 2021, which has since expired. This report describes ARPA’s EITC expansion for childless workers and PolicyEngine’s projected impacts of restoring it today.

## What is the Earned Income Tax Credit?

The EITC is a federal tax credit for low- and moderate-income working individuals and families, [originally signed into law](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44825.pdf) by President Ford in 1975 and made permanent by President Carter in 1978. The US [limits the EITC](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-earned-income-tax-credit) to filers with earned income, allotting recipients a credit equaling a percentage of earnings up to a certain maximum. The rate and maximum credit vary by family size, with larger credits for families with more children.

A critical feature of the EITC is that it is a “refundable” credit — meaning that if the value of the credit exceeds taxes owed, the taxpayer receives the excess as a refund. It also phases in and out gradually. The credit amount increases as earned income increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases as earned income exceeds the phase-out threshold.

Historically, the EITC did not support childless workers. That changed with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which created a new credit formula that included low-income workers without qualifying children. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan [further expanded the EITC](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/year-end-tax-policy-priority-expand-the-child-tax-credit-for-the-19-million) for workers without qualifying children. That change — which the Biden administration wants to make permanent — expired at the end of 2021.

## What are the current impacts of the childless EITC?

For each individual, the IRS [determines the value of the EITC](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-22-38.pdf) by earned income — which includes wages, salaries, and self-employment income. For workers without children in tax year 2023, the EITC provides a credit of 7.65% of earned income with a maximum credit of $600. The phaseout begins when annual income exceeds $9,800 and terminates when income reaches $17,640. To view this graphically, see the chart below from [this PolicyEngine page](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=14695) that displays the credit amount received by a single individual without children at different levels of earned income.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3076/0*PKoG8QuJtyyrVTe5)

Correspondingly, such an individual faces a spike in their marginal tax rate between $17,500 and $19,000 of employment income when the EITC completely phases out. To model the impact of the childless EITC on marginal tax rates in PolicyEngine, visit [this page](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=14695).

To compute the macro impact of the childless EITC using PolicyEngine, [compare current law against abolishing it](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525). According to this simulation, [the childless EITC costs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525) $2.3 billion. This represents 5.4% of our [projected total EITC cost](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=5331) of $42.7bn. However, this figure falls 38.8% below the [JCT estimate of the program](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/jcx-22-22/), $69.8bn, which likely stems from the CPS under-capturing low-income households. [We will enhance the CPS data later this year](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis), which should more closely align this estimate to administrative totals.

Additionally, we project that the childless EITC [reduces the poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525) by 0.6% and [the deep poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525) by 0.8%, and [increases the average household’s net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525) by $17. The childless EITC disproportionately benefits lower-income workers, but due to the small absolute impact, it [reduces income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=6525) by less than 0.1%.

## How did the ARPA expand the childless EITC?

In 2021, ARPA made the following changes to the EITC for childless workers:

1. Lowered the applicable minimum age from 25 to 19

1. Eliminated the maximum age (previously 65)

1. Raised the maximum credit amount from $560[^1] to $1,502

1. Raised the phase-in and phase-out rates from 7.65% to 15.3%

1. Raised the income threshold at which the phase-out begins from $5,280[^2] to $11,610

1. Allowed separate filers in the same household to be eligible for the EITC

[^1]: The value of $600 mentioned in the previous section is the inflation-adjusted figure for 2023.

[^2]: Today’s inflation-adjusted value is $9,800.

## Limitations of PolicyEngine’s EITC model

Before assessing PolicyEngine’s projected impacts of restoring these changes, it is necessary to note the limitations and assumptions of our model.

First, we do not model the full complexity of the modified minimum age, which contained exceptions for students, homeless youth, and former foster youth.[^3] Our forecast assumes that the minimum age is 19 for all childless workers.

[^3]: The minimum age for “[specified students](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=26-USC-2036225077-1503094078&term_occur=999&term_src=title:26:subtitle:A:chapter:1:subchapter:A:part:IV:subpart:C:section:32)” was only lowered to 24, and the minimum age for both “[qualified former foster youth](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=26-USC-488059477-1503094078&term_occur=999&term_src=title:26:subtitle:A:chapter:1:subchapter:A:part:IV:subpart:C:section:32)” and “[qualified homeless youth](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=26-USC-1746670673-1503094078&term_occur=999&term_src=title:26:subtitle:A:chapter:1:subchapter:A:part:IV:subpart:C:section:32)” was lowered further to 18.

Second, our values for the maximum credit amount and income phase-out threshold are taken directly from ARPA itself, which did not contain inflation adjustments (as the provisions expired in the same fiscal year). Restoration of the ARPA EITC expansion would plausibly adjust these values for inflation; accordingly, our model’s projections may understate the impacts of reinstating these changes today.

As discussed above, we follow the CPS data’s understatement of low-income tax credits like the EITC.

## How would restoring the ARPA childless EITC expansion affect the US?

To compute the population-level impacts of restoring ARPA’s EITC expansion, click on ‘find an existing policy’ and select ‘[Restoring the ARPA EITC](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524).’ According to this model, the reform [would cost $10.4bn](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524) in 2023 and [increase the average household’s net income by $79](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524). Because filers living in the same household can qualify for the EITC, all income deciles would experience a rise in average net income.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ONBi9tKp9KU5r430)

However, in percentage terms, the policy would provide [more significant benefits to lower-income deciles](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524). The relative change in income is highest for the lowest decile at 0.79% and decreases as the income decile increases.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*L3XIeQX8BmRApiXG)

These benefits would [affect households comprising 12% of the population](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524). For 3.2% of Americans, the policy would cause net incomes to rise by more than 5% — disproportionately those in the bottom four deciles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2744/0*xmfrxZWnWHnjFULM)

Our model of the Supplemental Poverty Measure indicates that the reform [reduces the overall poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524) from 9.6% to 9.4%, a 2% decline.

Unsurprisingly, the most significant poverty reduction would be for working-age adults, as the expanded credits would accrue directly to employed adults without children. However, the child poverty rate would decline as well. This is likely due to adults living in households with children — but who are not themselves parents — newly qualifying for the EITC under the ARPA expansion. Additionally, the poverty rate for seniors would decline by 0.8%, likely due to ARPA eliminating the maximum age requirement.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2704/0*6vdoNuRsqVxry6Sw)

The expansion would also [lower deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524) — the population share below half their Supplemental Poverty Measure threshold — by 0.9%. Again with the most significant reduction for working-age adults.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2636/0*9n6R0cOgRIp8M_83)

The reductions in [poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524) and [deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderDeepPovertyImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524) from restoring ARPA’s childless EITC expansion would be slightly larger for males than females.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2640/0*0R00fQj5KFC1CeDP)

For men and women, the reform cuts deep poverty by about half as much as it cuts poverty.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2752/0*LBdDOM9LeUG_w_OQ)

Additionally, the reform would [reduce income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524), but only slightly. The Gini coefficient — a measure of income inequality — would decrease from 0.414 to 0.413. The share of income held by the top decile of households would fall from 31.6% to 31.5%, and the share held by the top 1% would remain stable at 7.8%.

Lastly, restoring the ARPA EITC would make “cliffs” (a.k.a. [benefit cliffs or welfare cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-02-how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs)) [more prevalent](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6524). The cliff rate — the share of households whose net income would fall if each adult earned an additional $2,000 — would remain unchanged. However, the cliff gap — the sum of the losses incurred by all households on a cliff — would increase by 0.4%.

The Biden administration has proposed making ARPA’s EITC expansion for childless workers permanent to “help pull low-paid workers out of poverty.”

We predict that restoring the ARPA expansion in 2023 would reduce the poverty rate by 2.0% and the deep poverty rate by 0.9% while increasing the average net income of households in the lowest three deciles by over $100.

While there are limitations to PolicyEngine’s EITC model, it provides a valuable tool for assessing the potential impacts of this policy change. The expansion would benefit lower-income workers and would, in fact, pull some of them out of poverty.

# The District Child Tax Credit proposal
Slug: district-child-tax-credit
Date: 2023-04-02 09:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, us-dc, policy
Description: Analysis of DC Councilmember Zachary Parker's new legislation.

---

_We thank the [Mother’s Outreach Network](https://mothersoutreachnetwork.org/) for supporting this research. PolicyEngine conducts all research independently of our funders._

On March 3, 2023, DC Councilmember Zachary Parker, along with eight other councilmembers, introduced the [District Child Tax Credit Amendment Act of 2023](http://ward5.us/dctc) (DCTC), which proposes a credit of up to $500 per child for eligible filers, depending on their income and family structure.

This report delves into the DCTC, providing an overview of the credit, examples of how households could be affected, scenario analysis for various filer types, and potential impacts on poverty and income inequality. Additionally, the report contextualizes the DCTC within DC’s broader tax-benefit system, highlighting the differences in phase-out structures and eligibility criteria compared to other programs.

## The District Child Tax Credit

The DCTC proposes that, starting in the tax year 2026, eligible filers would receive a refundable credit of up to $500 for each qualifying child, up to a limit of three children. Refundable credits can reduce a filer’s tax liability below zero, effectively functioning as benefits paid through the tax code, independent of regular tax liability.

Qualifying children are defined as those eligible for the federal Child Tax Credit, which includes children under the age of 17. The bill also proposes reducing the credit by $20 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount, with different thresholds for single filers ($100,000) and joint returns ($145,000). A taxpayer is ineligible to receive this credit if they do not claim the eligible child as a dependent on their federal and District income tax returns, if someone else claims the eligible child, or if the taxpayer has not resided in the District of Columbia for at least one year prior to the date of filing.

## Example household

Consider a household with two children, ages 10 and 16, and an adjusted gross income of $110,000. The DCTC would make them eligible for a maximum credit of $1,000 ($500 per child). However, since their income exceeds the threshold amount for single (head of household) filers by $10,000, the credit falls by $200 ($20 for each $1,000, or 2%). Therefore, the household will receive a final credit of $800.

For a single filer with two children, the credit fully phases out if their income reaches $150,000 ($100,000 phase-out threshold + $1,000 credit / 2% phase-out rate = $100,000 + $50,000).

**To see how the DCTC would affect your own household, [enter your information into our personalized calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201).**

_Note that our calculator does not reflect the limit of three children or the one-year tenure requirement. It also assumes that your household files taxes together, not married filing separately on the same return._

## Scenario analysis

A filer’s DCTC depends on their marital status, number of children, and income, as illustrated in the following chart. Applying similar math to the previous section, the credit fully phases out for single filers with one child at $125,000, two children at $150,000, and three children at $175,000. For married joint filers, the credit fully phases out at $45,000 higher income: $170,000 for one child, $195,000 for two children, and $220,000 for three children.

## DC-wide impacts

PolicyEngine estimates population-level impacts by pairing its rules engine with representative survey data released by the US Census Bureau. Specifically, it uses the 2021 [Current Population Survey March Supplement](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) (CPS), the official source of poverty metrics, and pairs this with policy rules for 2023. Of the 59,148 households in the CPS, 1,135 reside in DC. Given this relatively small sample size, [PolicyEngine plans to enhance this dataset in the future](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis), and this will also facilitate farther-out predictions, such as tax year 2026 when the DCTC would take effect. As we have not yet modeled DC income taxes, we also assume that filers apply the same filing status as on their federal return, rather than married couples filing separately on the same return, as DC allows.

PolicyEngine estimates that the DCTC would [cost about $27 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201) in 2023. This equates to [$84 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), or [0.1% of net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), disproportionately to those in the second through fourth income deciles. Overall, the policy would [reduce income inequality by 0.1–0.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), depending on the metric.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*clzTvjQqGl8RPfbg)

[One in five Washingtonians would benefit from the DCTC](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), also disproportionately those in the second through fourth income deciles. One in twenty would see their net income rise by at least five percent, including one in five in the second income decile. Those in the bottom decile benefit less because these households have fewer children.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ZK8syfSSOghJdTFi)

The DCTC would [reduce the poverty rate by 1.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), from 14.0% to 13.8%, as measured by the [Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html), which considers taxes, transfers, and local housing costs. Child poverty would fall 5.2%, from 13.8% to 13.0%. PolicyEngine also estimates that the DCTC would [disproportionately reduce poverty among men](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201), and that it would [not affect deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201) (people with income below half the poverty line), though these likely result from small sample sizes.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*GGCE1U95070AYxGC)

## Context of DC’s tax-benefit system

As a refundable tax credit, the DCTC would effectively serve as a benefit paid through the tax system. Some other refundable tax credits and cash benefits in DC include:

- [DC Earned Income Tax Credit](https://eitc.dc.gov/page/frequently-asked-questions-10) (EITC), which currently matches 70% of the federal EITC and will match 100% beginning in 2026

- [DC Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/2022_Sch_H.pdf) provides a credit based on property tax or rent paid, age, and income

- [DC Keep Child Care Affordable Credit](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/2022_Sch_ELC.pdf) provides a credit based on childcare expenses, children and their ages, and income

- [DC Temporary Assistance for Needy Families](https://dhs.dc.gov/service/tanf-district-families) (TANF), which provides cash assistance to low-income families with children

While PolicyEngine does not yet model these programs for a quantitative comparison, we can describe some ways in which the DCTC diverges from them.

One difference is the phase out structure. The DCTC phases out more slowly and at a higher income than other DC programs: at 2% of income exceeding $100,000 or $145,000. For comparison, the DC EITC for filers with children phases out at 11–15% of income exceeding $21,560.[^1] The Homeowner and Renter Property Credit has a [cliff](https://blog.policyengine.org/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs-c390fffcfdf7) at $57,600 income, or $78,600 for those age 70 or above. The Keep Childcare Affordable Tax Credit also has a cliff, at $157,200 income ($78,600 for married filing separately). TANF too has a cliff at its income limit, which varies with household size (e.g. $712 per month for a family of three). As a result of the DCTC design, it [avoids contributing to welfare cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&household=24552&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=6201).

[^1]: The EITC phases out at 15.98% for filers with one child and 21.06% for filers with two or more children. These result in 11–15% when multiplied by DC’s 70% multiplier.

The DCTC also depends on fewer household characteristics than other programs. The Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit depends on rent and property taxes; the Keep Child Care Affordable Credit depends on childcare expenses; TANF depends on assets. The DCTC depends only on children, marital status, and income.

## Conclusion

The District Child Tax Credit Amendment Act of 2023 proposes a refundable credit of up to $500 per child. The program would take effect for the 2026 tax year, issuing its first refunds in early 2027.

Given full take-up, PolicyEngine estimates that it would cost about $27 million, reach 20% of the DC population, reduce child poverty by about 5%, and reduce income inequality by 0.1–0.2%. The design of the DCTC, featuring a gradual phase-out structure and fewer household characteristic dependencies, distinguishes it from other DC programs and may help to mitigate welfare cliffs.

As PolicyEngine continues to refine its model of other DC programs and improve its microdata, the accuracy of estimates for the DCTC’s distributional, budgetary, and incentive effects within the DC public policy environment will also improve. The availability of more data and enhanced capabilities of PolicyEngine could pave the way for future studies, offering additional insights into the potential impact of the DCTC on families in the District of Columbia.

# Announcing the addition of Kansas income tax to PolicyEngine
Slug: kansas-income-tax
Date: 2023-04-03 09:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, us-ks, policy
Description: We've expanded our tax calculator and customizable reform simulator to the Sunflower State.

---

We are excited to announce the addition of the Kansas income tax code to [PolicyEngine US](http://legacy.policyengine.org/us)! This update allows users to analyze and understand the tax policies in Kansas, including tax rates, deductions, exemptions, and credits available to Kansas residents.

## How Kansas income taxes work

Kansas levies income taxes at different rates for joint and non-joint filers. The tax brackets and rates are as follows:

For joint filers:

- 3.1% on income up to $30,000

- 5.25% on income between $30,000 and $60,000

- 5.7% on income over $60,000

For non-joint filers:

- 3.1% on income up to $15,000

- 5.25% on income between $15,000 and $30,000

- 5.7% on income over $30,000

Kansas offers a personal exemption of $2,250 per person. It allows either itemized deductions or a standard deduction ranging from $3,500 to $8,000, depending on filing status, with a bonus for elderly and blind filers. The state also limits its taxable Social Security subtraction to filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) at or below $75,000.

In addition to the tax rates and exemptions, Kansas also matches 25% of the federal Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC) and 17% of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

The addition of the Kansas income tax code to PolicyEngine will enable users to better understand the impact of tax policies on Kansas residents. Users can now model different policy scenarios, analyze the effects of proposed tax reforms, and explore the intricacies of Kansas state income tax.

We encourage you to explore the new Kansas tax policies on PolicyEngine and see how they affect your own tax situation or the broader population. Our team remains committed to expanding the platform’s capabilities and providing you with the most comprehensive tax policy analysis tool available. Stay tuned for more updates and new features!

# Introducing California income tax analysis on PolicyEngine

_We thank [AllHome](http://allhomeca.org) for supporting this model enhancement._

We are thrilled to announce the expansion of PolicyEngine to include the California income tax code! This update enables users to examine, comprehend, and adjust tax policies in California — from rates and brackets to deductions and credits.

## How California income taxes work

California has nine tax brackets, with rates ranging from 1% to 12.3% and thresholds up to $1.35 million, depending on filing status. In addition, California levies a 1% tax on income above $1 million and a use tax of roughly 0.009% of income.

Like on federal income taxes, California filers can take either a standard or itemized deduction when determining their taxable income. The standard deduction is $5,202 for single and married filing separately filers, and double that for others. Itemized deductions mostly mirror the federal set, though California starts to cap their value at income above about $230,000, depending on filing status. California filers can also subtract taxable Social Security payments from their state adjusted gross income.

PolicyEngine also models several California tax credits:

- California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) applies multipliers to a modified version of the federal EITC for filers with some earned income below $30,000

- Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC) provided up to $1,083 to filers eligible for CalEITC (with some exceptions) and children under age six

- Child and Dependent Care Credit matches up to 50% of the federal program of the same name, for filers with up to $100,000 income

- Exemptions of $140 per filer and spouse, and $433 per dependent; all exemptions phase out starting at income above about $230,000, depending on filing status (the same thresholds as the itemized deduction cap)

- Renter credit provides $60 to single filers who pay rent and have income below $49,220; California doubles the amount and threshold for other filer types

_All values reflect the 2022 tax year. As California bases its inflation adjustments on mid-year price levels, we cannot yet enter 2023 tax parameters._

The integration of the California income tax code into PolicyEngine allows users to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of tax policies on California residents. Users can now simulate different policy scenarios, assess the effects of proposed tax reforms, and delve into the details of California state income tax.

We invite you to explore the new California tax policies on PolicyEngine and see how they influence your tax situation or the broader population. Our team is dedicated to expanding the platform’s capabilities and delivering the most comprehensive tax policy analysis tool available. Keep an eye out for more updates and new features!

# PolicyEngine adds New York Family Assistance (TANF) to US model

Description: Enhancing analysis of public policy impacts on needy families.

---

Today we are expanding our tax-benefit model to include [New York Family Assistance](https://otda.ny.gov/programs/temporary-assistance/), the state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This update allows for better understanding of the program’s impact on recipients and the wider community. In this blog post, we will outline the key features of the New York TANF program, as well as some important considerations in the model’s calculations.

## How New York Family Assistance works

The New York TANF program provides financial assistance to eligible families, with the maximum benefit level dependent on household size. The program determines eligibility through the need standard, which considers both earned and unearned income. The countable income for the need standard is calculated by applying certain disregards and exclusions to the recipient’s earnings.

In New York, the Earned Income Disregard (EID) is set at 50% as of October 1, 2022, and will be adjusted annually beginning June 1, 2023. This means that 50% of a recipient’s earned income is excluded from the countable income calculation for eligibility. Additionally, the first $150 of monthly earnings is disregarded as a work expense. It is important to note that the policy of only applying the EID for earnings up to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for those residing in temporary housing shelter types remains unchanged.

Eligibility for the New York TANF program is also determined by demographic factors. Generally, a child is eligible if they are under 18 years of age or under 19 if they are a full-time student. New York limits eligibility to households with less than $2,000 in resources, or $3,000 if the household contains anyone aged 60 or older. While New York technically applies income limits, it is structured to mirror the benefit amount exceeding zero, making it effectively null.

## Example household

Consider a [single parent of one](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=29579) in the chart below. They could receive up to $252 per month ($3,024 per year) if they earn less than the $150 earnings disregard. The benefit then phases out at 50 cents per dollar of earnings, until it reaches zero when they earn $654 ($7,848 per year).

_This chart doesn’t exactly capture all vertices, as it is in $500 earnings increments._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2848/0*7GPmyNzntYSko6uX)

PolicyEngine’s model computes various factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the New York TANF program’s effects on eligible families and the broader community. The model’s inclusion of the New York TANF program aids policymakers, researchers, and the public in examining the program’s impact, exploring potential policy changes, and facilitating informed discussions on the future of public assistance programs like TANF.

In conclusion, PolicyEngine’s model, now featuring the New York TANF program, serves as an essential resource for those interested in the effects of social welfare policies, leading to better-informed policy decisions and an enhanced understanding of the program’s impact on families and communities.

# Analysis of the DC Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act
Slug: dc-financial-support-for-families-with-children

Description: Evaluating Councilmember Zachary Parker's second Child Tax Credit proposal of 2023.

---

_We thank the [Mother’s Outreach Network](https://mothersoutreachnetwork.org/) for supporting this research. PolicyEngine conducts all research independently of our funders._

[We recently examined the District Child Tax Credit (DCTC)](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/district-child-tax-credit), a proposed bill from DC Councilmember Zachary Parker. Today, we will examine another proposal from Councilmember Parker called the [Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act (FSFC)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/14865nw8firxgo2/CM%20Parker%20Basic%20Income%20Bill%203.21.23_FINAL.pdf?dl=0) and its potential economic impact on Washington, D.C. residents.

## The Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act

Beginning in the 2024 tax year, the FSFC would provide up to $1,000 per year to children eligible for the federal Child Tax Credit (those below age 17). It reduces the credit by $100 per $1,000 (10% marginal tax rate) of adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding specific thresholds: $10,000, or $20,000 for joint filers.

## Example household

Consider a married household with two children, ages 10 and 16, and an adjusted gross income of $25,000. The FSFCA would make them eligible for a maximum credit of $2,000 ($1,000 per child). However, since their income exceeds the $20,000 threshold amount for joint filers by $5,000, the credit falls by $500 ($100 for each $1,000, or 10%). Therefore, the household will receive a final credit of $1,500.

For a joint filer with two children, the credit fully phases out if their income reaches $40,000 ($20,000 phase-out threshold + $2,000 credit / 10% phase-out rate = $20,000 + $20,000).

**To see how the FSFC would affect your own household, [enter your information into our personalized calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=8007&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).**

_Note that our calculator assumes that your household files taxes together, not married filing separately on the same return._

## Scenario analysis

A filer’s FSFC depends on their marital status, number of children, and income, as illustrated in the following chart. Applying similar math to the previous section, the credit fully phases out for single filers with one child at $20,000 income, two children at $30,000, and three children at $40,000. For married joint filers, the credit fully phases out at $10,000 higher income: $30,000 for one child, $40,000 for two children, and $50,000 for three children.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*BCBH9b-nkhBgfGih)

## DC-wide impacts

We estimate DC-wide impacts by pairing our 2023 rules engine with the 2021 [Current Population Survey March Supplement](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) (CPS), which contains 1,135 DC households. As we have not yet modeled DC income taxes, we also assume that filers apply the same filing status as on their federal return, rather than married couples filing separately on the same return, as DC allows.

PolicyEngine estimates that the FSFA would [cost about $27 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) in 2023. This equates to [$84 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), or [0.1% of net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately to households in the second income decile (households in the bottom income decile have fewer children). Overall, the policy would [reduce income inequality by 0.0–0.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), depending on the metric.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2828/0*Zv6RqNmcgMkrlHWa)

[The FSFC would benefit one in ten Washingtonians](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and one in twelve would see their net income rise by at least five percent.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2820/0*Z3wEluteyWjEyx3R)

14.0% of Washingtonians have resources below their [Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html) threshold. We estimate that the FSFC would affect poverty rates [identically to the DCTC](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/district-child-tax-credit): lowering the rate 1.3% to 13.8%, child poverty by 5.2%, larger poverty reductions among men, and no deep poverty impact. In reality, the policies would have different effects, but given the small sample sizes, similar surveyed households fall near the poverty line and would be pushed above it by both the DCTC and FSFC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2848/0*JkBfpEumAbVkTxpM)

According to our data, the FSFC’s poverty reduction would be [entirely felt by Black non-Hispanic Washingtonians](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), reducing their poverty rate from 22.9% to 22.5%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2844/0*CDnH3pVVtjeVdm8o)

To contextualize our results in DC, which carry noise due to the small sample size, we can compare poverty impacts to the FSFC’s if it were enacted nationwide. Across the US, the FSFC would reduce deep poverty by 60% more than it reduces poverty, including 31% deep child poverty reductions. It would have similar poverty impacts by sex, but reduce deep poverty more among women. Its impact on Black and Hispanic poverty rates would be about double the impact on White non-Hispanic poverty rates.

**FSFC poverty reduction by population subset and geography**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Tw9pytP4VTrTj4C108ee1g.png)

## Comparing Financial Support for Families with Children to the District Child Tax Credit

Councilmember Parker proposed the FSFC on March 23, three weeks after proposing the DCTC. Councilmembers George, Allen, Pinto, and Robert White joined Parker by co-introducing both bills (Chair Mendelson and Councilmembers Henderson, Trayon White Sr., and Nadeau additionally co-introduced the DCTC). While the proposals share common features as tax credits for families with children, and PolicyEngine projects similar impacts, they also differ in important respects.

FSFC provides larger benefits to a lower-income population and phases out faster; however, the DCTC targets in some ways that FSFC does not, by enacting a child cap and residency requirement. FSFC would also take effect two years before the DCTC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2784/1*cLrx9sthXcVS5AsNduRdIA.png)

PolicyEngine estimates that FSFC has identical impacts to the DCTC on the budget and poverty rates, though [more comprehensive data](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) would likely identify differences. FSFC would reduce inequality about 50% more by targeting transfers to a population about half the size of the DCTC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2776/1*7mA6fraWhMVGC2I2c_-Srg.png)

## Context of other DC programs for low-income families

Like the DCTC, the FSFC would be available to families that don’t have to otherwise file taxes. To complement the background we provided in the DCTC report on TANF and the EITC, we provide some relevant statistics on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit.

The DC Department of Health and Human Services administers DC’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which targets similarly low-income families with children. The federal Department of Health and Human Services reports that [4,288 families](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/fy2022_tanf_caseload.pdf) participated in DC’s TANF program in an average month in 2022.

DC residents can claim the Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit (HRPTC) on the [Schedule H](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/2020_Schedule_H_0.pdf) tax form. Residents that pay rent or property tax can claim the HRPTC, unless they live in one of the District’s roughly [10,000 public housing units](https://www.dchousing.org/wordpress/about-us/dcha-by-the-numbers/), or exceed the income limits. Roughly [250,000 individuals](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=9008&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) are in tax filing units with income below the $57,600 main HRPTC income limit (higher-income filers can qualify if they are age 70 or above).

FSFC, meanwhile, would be available to about 70,000 individuals.

## Conclusion

The Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act of 2023 proposes a refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child for low-income families. The program would take effect for the 2024 tax year, issuing its first refunds in early 2025.

Given full take-up, PolicyEngine estimates that it would cost about $27 million, reach 10% of the DC population, reduce child poverty by about 5%, and reduce a broad measure of income inequality by 0.3%.

Beyond data limitations, a dynamic macroeconomic model may project different results than we do. Standard labor supply models consider the extent to which a program affects net income (“income effect”) and the extent to which it affects one’s marginal tax rate (“substitution effect”). Compared to the District Child Tax Credit, the FSFC would create both effects in larger magnitudes, since it increases income more on a relative basis for those affected (by targeting low income households) and phases out at a faster rate (adding ten rather than two percentage points to marginal tax rates).

As policymakers and stakeholders evaluate the FSFC in the context of existing programs like TANF, the DCTC, and the HRPTC, a comprehensive understanding of each proposal’s unique aspects will be essential for informed decision-making. This analysis serves as a basis for further discussion and evaluation of the potential effects of the FSFC on families and children across various income levels in Washington, D.C.

# Introducing Utah State Income Tax Analysis on PolicyEngine

_Utah’s State Capitol. Credit: Ramon M._

Today, we are excited to announce the expansion of PolicyEngine to include the Utah State income tax code. This update enables users to simulate, and adjust tax policies in Utah on their own household or the State’s economy — from rates and credits to deductions and exemptions.

## Utah State’s income tax code

Utah has a main income tax rate of 4.85% (as of the 2022 tax year) that applies to all taxable income. The Utah income tax system allows a set of non-refundable tax credits, of which we model five:

- Utah taxpayer credit: an initial amount that phases out with income

- Utah EITC: 15% of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit

- Utah Social Security Benefits Credit (SSBC): a credit that effectively makes social security tax-exempt for filers under an income threshold, phasing out

- Utah retirement credit: an alternative to the Utah SSBC that provides a flat rate instead, phasing out earlier

- Utah at-home parent credit: $100 per child under 12 months, with income cutoffs for both the stay-at-home parent and the tax unit

These credits reduce the income tax liability for qualifying taxpayers, resulting in the overall tax schedule shown below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3152/0*f7_wm_N_NCceKF7l)

_Utah’s income tax, by household type and employment income._

## The Utah taxpayer credit

The taxpayer credit is calculated as a percentage of the sum of the taxpayer’s federal deductions and the Utah taxpayer credit personal exemption. The maximum taxpayer credit rate is 6%. In 2022, the Utah taxpayer credit personal exemption is $1,802. This exemption is added to the taxpayer’s federal standard or itemized deductions when calculating the taxpayer credit.

The taxpayer credit is subject to phase-out based on income levels and filing status. The credit reduces by a rate of 1.3% for each dollar of income above the phase-out threshold. In 2022, the phase-out thresholds for different filing statuses are as follows:

- Single: $15,548

- Married filing separately: $15,548

- Married filing jointly: $31,096

- Head of household: $23,322

- Qualifying widow(er): $31,096

## The Utah EITC

The Utah EITC is a flat percentage of the federal EITC, with no modifications to federal rules. In 2022, this percentage is 15%.

## The Utah Social Security Benefits Credit

This credit essentially exempts social security from Utah taxable income for filers with income below a filing-status-determined threshold, and phases the Utah tax on federally-taxable social security back in at a marginal rate of 2.5%. The phase-out thresholds for 2022 are:

- Single: $37,000

- Married filing separately: $31,000

- Married filing jointly: $62,000

- Head of household: $62,000

- Qualifying widow(er): $62,000

## The Utah retirement credit

The Utah retirement credit is an alternative to the Utah Social Security Benefits Credit (SSBC) and provides a flat rate credit for eligible taxpayers. To qualify for the Utah retirement credit, residents must have been born before 1952.

The maximum per-person value of the Utah retirement credit is $450. This credit is subject to phase-out based on modified adjusted gross income (AGI) levels and filing status. The phase-out rate is 2.5%. In 2022, the modified AGI phase-out thresholds for different filing statuses are as follows:

- Single: $25,000

- Married filing separately: $16,000

- Married filing jointly: $32,000

- Head of household: $32,000

- Qualifying widow(er): $32,000

Utah residents can claim only one of either the retirement credit or the social security benefits credit. It is assumed that they claim the one with the higher value. The Utah retirement credit is calculated using the taxpayer’s age, income, and filing status to determine eligibility and the appropriate phase-out reduction. If the retirement credit is refundable, it will be limited by the taxpayer’s income tax liability before credits, minus the Utah taxpayer credit and Utah EITC.

## The Utah at-home parent credit

Parents of children under 12 months can claim the at-home parent credit if:

- At least one of the parents has earned income below $3,000

- The adjusted gross income of the tax unit is less than $50,000

The value of the credit is $100 per qualifying child. The income cutoffs create a small [cliff effect](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs)- any rise in income over either income limit imposes an instant $100 tax increase, regardless of the size of the rise in income.

## Marginal tax rates

The interaction of the flat tax rate and the taxpayer credit effectively creates a multi-rate tax schedule, with rates between 0% and 12% (and a cliff at $50,000 employment income due to the at-home parent credit).

The integration of the Utah State income tax code into PolicyEngine allows users to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of tax policies on Utah residents. Users can now simulate different policy scenarios, assess the effects of proposed tax reforms, and delve into the details of Utah State income tax.

## Example reforms

Utah’s headline tax rate is currently 4.85%, but has seen reforms over recent years. Using PolicyEngine’s economic impact calculator, we can estimate the revenue impacts of small and large changes to the tax rate, shown below.

| **Tax rate** | **Tax rate change** | **Revenue impact** | **Average gain per household** | **PolicyEngine link**                                                                                                                           |

Because PolicyEngine uses a household survey, its revenue impacts are around a third lower than official estimates which use administrative tax datasets (which are less likely to miss out high-income filers). Our [planned data enhancement process](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) will improve accuracy up to the level of administrative datasets later this year.

# Kansas's Flat Tax Proposal — SB169

Description: We review how the bill works and model its impact with PolicyEngine US.

---

Following the [Kansas state house passing](https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/ks/2023-2024/bills/KSB00009649/) [Senate Bill 169](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/documents/sb169_02_0000.pdf) last week, Governor Laura Kelly today [vetoed](https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-04-24/kansas-governor-vetoes-huge-a-tax-relief-plan-saying-its-flat-tax-favors-the-rich) the tax reform legislation. SB169 would have replaced its three-bracket income tax to a single 5.25% rate, making it the sixth state to enact legislation [converting to a flat income tax structure](https://taxfoundation.org/flat-tax-state-income-tax-reform/). The bill also has provisions that affect corporate, sales, property, and bank taxes, as well as several exemptions, deductions, and credits.

This post examines the details of these reforms and [PolicyEngine’s forecasted impacts](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918) of implementing SB 169 in the current tax year.

[See how SB 169 would affect your household with PolicyEngine’s personalized calculator.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918)

## How would SB169 change Kansas’s tax system, and how much does PolicyEngine model?

SB169 would enact nine changes to the tax system. Below we list them, and also note the extent to which PolicyEngine models them.

1. **Flatten the current graduated-rate income tax,** which currently reaches 5.7%, to 5.25% on income above $5,225 (single) and $12,300 (joint).
   _Fully modeled._

1. **Increase the standard deduction for single filers** from $3,500 to $4,000.
   _Fully modeled._

1. **Inflation-adjust the standard deduction** in future years for all filers.
   _Not applicable to PolicyEngine’s one-year model._

1. **Eliminate the nonrefundable Food Sales Tax credit,** which would otherwise end in 2025.
   _Fully modeled._

1. **Eliminate the sales tax on unprepared food.** _PolicyEngine does not model sales taxes. Note however that food purchased with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (food stamps) are already [exempt from sales taxes](<https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Can-sales-tax-be-charged-on-items-I-bought-with-Supplemental-Nutrition-Assistance-Program-benefits#:~:text=Information&text=No%2C%20retailers%20cannot%20charge%20sales,Assistance%20Program%20(SNAP)%20benefits.>)._

1. **Expand the income tax exemption for Social Security benefits:** Under current law, Kansans whose total adjusted gross income is $75,000 or less are exempt from taxes on their social security benefits, while those above this threshold are fully taxed. Instead, SB169 would gradually phase out the subtraction for Social Security benefits between $75,000 and $100,000 of adjusted gross income.
   _PolicyEngine models the existing exemption, but this reform amends the structure of the exemption in a way that the app cannot model. We therefore exclude it from this analysis, though invite analysts to model it in our Python package._

1. **Decrease the normal tax rate for corporations.** _Not modeled._

1. **Raise the exemption ceiling for residential property taxes.** _Not modeled._

1. **Reduce the tax rate on banks.** _Not modeled._

PolicyEngine’s limitations may result in our understating the net income benefits to Kansans and the state revenue losses from implementing SB169. Beyond the policies we do not model, our reliance on the Current Population Survey creates inaccuracies that we [intend to remedy later this year](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis).

## How would SB169 affect individual households?

To explore the effect of SB169 on individuals, we will examine three different sample households: a single 55-year-old, a family of four, and a 70-year-old who receives Social Security.

For an able-bodied single 55-year-old with no dependents, the bill would [increase their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918&household=30049) if they earn less than $16,500 annually or greater than $30,000 annually. Between these two earnings levels, SB169 causes losses of up to $100 of net income due to the bill eliminating the [food sales tax credit](https://www.kansas.gov/kdor/webfile/help/modal-food-sales-credit-details.html#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20credit%20is,exemption%20for%20Head%20of%20Household).) (FSTC) that currently applies to those with an adjusted gross income (AGI) below $30,615.

We must reiterate that our model does not include eliminating the food sales tax, which may counteract some of these losses. A single individual with no dependents earning more than $17,676 annually is [not eligible for SNAP](https://content.dcf.ks.gov/EES/KEESM/Appendix/F-2_FA_Standards.pdf) in Kansas, so their expenditures on unprepared food are [currently taxed](https://www.ksrevenue.gov/pub1223.html) at 4%. SB169 would eliminate this tax, so our model may overstate the net income losses for such individuals earning between $17,676-$30,615 of AGI.

With that in mind, the chart below shows our projected [change in net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918&household=30049) for a Kansan with these characteristics at different earning levels.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zs4irO8pZV0D55TycVH9Qw.png)

The sudden spike above $30,000 occurs when they are no longer eligible for the FSTC, so SB169 would lower their income tax rate without causing them to lose these benefits. Net income gains continue to increase linearly above $35,500 as the bill reduces the rate for individuals in the top marginal tax bracket from 5.7% to 5.25%.

Currently, a 55-year-old with no dependents between $18,500-$19,500 of AGI faces an effective marginal tax rate greater than 100%, meaning their net income actually declines as their earnings increase. Under SB169, this cliff would extend to $20,000 of AGI, as shown by the chart below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qd_RP_kweLSuNuyKTCEoDw.png)

The following chart shows the [percentage point change in marginal tax rates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918&household=30049) for these individuals at different income levels. The difference stabilizes above $36,000 of AGI, reflecting the tax decrease for higher earners who experience no changes to their state benefits.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gNvnldVmUxMrndZqNToFag.png)

Next, we will consider the impacts of SB169 on a 40-year-old married individual with two children. As shown by the next chart, the bill would [increase or cause no change](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918&household=30065) to their net income at all earnings levels. Up to $20,000 of AGI, the bill would have no effect, and if they earn more, they would benefit. (The flat value between $47,000-$77,000 is slightly positive, though close to 0).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sqd7AEEDFippG852CY5UWA.png)

However, SB169 would slightly extend a cliff between $39,00-$47,500 for families with these characteristics and leave a second cliff between $55,500-$59,000 intact. This results from the increased marginal tax rates it would create in that earnings range.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4ur6n5R3osxEQzMQEvX7Gw.png)

Next, we will consider the [projected changes in net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918&household=30070) for a single 70-year-old with no dependents. These effects are almost identical in shape and magnitude to those for a single 55-year-old, as shown by the chart below. This is because we do not model SB169’s expansion of the income tax exemption for Social Security benefits, which would benefit seniors between $75,000-$100,000 of AGI.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*FCRNnAdNG9MScT9JbFl8wQ.png)

## How would SB169 affect Kansas as a whole?

To simulate the state-wide impacts of SB169 in 2023, navigate to ‘compute the impact of policy reforms’ from PolicyEngine’s homepage, click on ‘find an existing policy,’ select ‘[Kansas SB169 2023](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918)’ from the dropdown box, and choose Kansas from the list of states. According to this model, the reform would cost the state [approximately $240 million in lost tax revenue](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918) and increase the average household’s [net income by $201](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QztrXJyJb8iTD3FFKs2-dQ.png)

[In percentage terms](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918), the average change in disposable income also increases for higher earners, ranging from +0.1% for the lowest income decile to +0.5% for the highest income decile.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NzJrJ3JSoAOpWG0kKQ5Gqw.png)

Those benefits would [accrue to households comprising 67%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918) of Kansas’s population. Yet, 0.6% of Kansans would lose out due to SB169, all in the bottom three income deciles. This is likely because the bill eliminates the FSTC. (Again, keep in that our model does not include eliminating the food sales tax itself, which, depending on SNAP eligibility, may counteract some of these losses).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*kfhRjwqmheqozjEzJXtwbg.png)

Despite causing gains in net income for many individuals, the bill would not affect [the poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918) or [deep poverty rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=8918) in Kansas. Additionally, although the share of income earned by the top 10% and 1% of earners [will increase due to SB169](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=8918&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), the Gini index — a measure of income inequality — will remain unchanged.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*d5H7vilV23Ha9r3I-0Yk-w.png)

Lastly, the bill would make cliffs [more prevalent](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=8918&region=ks&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). The cliff rate — the share of households whose net income would fall if each adult earned an additional $2,000 — would rise 15.8% from 1.7% to 2%. And the cliff gap — the sum of losses incurred by households on a cliff — would increase by 3.6% from $50.5 million to $52.3 million.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ECyeIZGQEBxzqkylYLWxGQ.png)

As demonstrated when we considered specific individuals, the bill increases marginal tax rates in particular earning ranges in ways that interact with the phaseout of benefits like SNAP and the FSTC to cause these cliffs.

If enacted, SB169 would replace Kansas’s progressive tax system with a flat income tax rate of 5.25% and alter several other tax provisions. According to PolicyEngine’s model of a subset of income tax provisions, the reform would result in a revenue loss of around $240 million for the state while increasing the average household’s net income by $201, with people in higher income deciles gaining the most.

We forecast that 0.6% of Kansans would experience losses due to SB169 eliminating the Food Sales Tax Credit, primarily in the bottom three income deciles. However, our model does not account for eliminating the food sales tax, which may offset these losses for some individuals.

The bill would not impact Kansas’s poverty or deep poverty rates, and though the share of income earned by the wealthiest citizens would increase, the Gini index would remain unchanged. Lastly, the reform would make income cliffs more prevalent, with the cliff rate rising by 15.8% and the cliff gap increasing by 3.6%.

As policymakers and Kansans weigh the benefits and drawbacks of this reform, it is essential to consider these impacts and their broader implications for the state’s tax and benefits system.

The high-profile Twitter bet between [James Medlock](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock) and [Balaji Srinivasan](http://twitter.com/balajis) has reached its conclusion, and PolicyEngine played a pivotal role in shaping the outcome. On March 16, 2023, [Medlock bet](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1636480393007489024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) that the US would not enter hyperinflation, with [Srinivasan taking the bet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and wagering that Bitcoin would exceed $1 million US dollars within 90 days. The bet garnered widespread attention, with Medlock pledging to donate a portion of his potential winnings to [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org), a charity that provides unconditional cash transfers to extremely poor households in East Africa.

Today Medlock announced the settlement of the bet, revealing that Srinivasan had donated $500,000 to GiveDirectly and transferred an additional $500,000 to Medlock. Srinivasan also donated $500,000 in BTC to support Bitcoin Core development via Chaincode.

In [our March 23 blog post](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/medlock-donation-calculator), we presented a [mini-app](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) built with the [policyengine-us Python package](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) to calculate how much Medlock should donate to GiveDirectly in order to fulfill his pledge of achieving a 70% effective tax rate between taxes and donations. Our calculations ranged from $333,000 to $565,000, depending on Medlock’s other income.

We are thrilled that our `policyengine-us` Python package and Streamlit-built dashboarding app could contribute to this charitable outcome by providing Medlock with the necessary calculations to determine his donation amount. This example demonstrates the power and flexibility of our Python packages, and we look forward to continuing to build tools that can answer unique questions and support decision-making in various scenarios.

Description: The proposal from the New School and the Economic Security Project would lower poverty and inequality while expanding cliffs.

---

In May 2021, researchers at the [New School’s Institute on Race and Political Economy](https://www.newschool.edu/institute-race-power-political-economy/), with support from the [Economic Security Project](https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/), released a paper titled, _[“Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century.”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDFPwUYu2Rf4RGgXuOTacmBj2Gt9paAV/view)_ The paper proposed a policy that expands the Earned Income Tax Credit by guaranteeing $12,500 per adult and $4,500 per child, phasing out for income above certain thresholds.

In this report, we depict the impact on a sample household, as well as on US-wide metrics like the budget, poverty, inequality, and cliffs. We also compare some estimates to the New School’s.

Overall, we find that the reform would, in 2023:

- [Cost $1.26 trillion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Benefit three in five Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Cut poverty 94%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Lower the Gini index of income inequality 19%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Increase the prevalence and severity of cliffs by 466% and 100%, respectively](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

This report describes and compares the New School’s proposal and analysis; calculates the impact for a sample household; and goes into these US-wide results in greater depth.

[See how Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century would affect your household.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

## The Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century proposal

_Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century_, or _21GI_ as the New School abbreviates it, would abolish the Earned Income Tax Credit and provide $12,500 per adult and $4,500 per child. The proposal then phases out the new benefit linearly with respect to the tax unit’s adjusted gross income, depending on number of adults: It would phase out from $10,000 to $50,000 for single-adult tax units, and from $15,000 to $70,000 for two-adult tax units. The below graphic, from 39:18 of the New School’s [video](https://vimeo.com/552064973), depicts the reform.

## Sample household

Consider a [single parent of one child in New York City](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31338). As they earn more, the net benefit of the 21GI falls, due to the shape of the EITC (in this case, federal, state, and local EITCs, since NYS and NYC based their EITCs on the federal), and the phase-out of the new payment itself.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3940/1*XTHawfysW_0cTtQTtO3V_w.jpeg)

This chart shows baseline (gray) and 21GI (blue) net income as the parent earns more. The shaded regions indicate “earnings dead zones”, where the household is worse off for earning due to cliffs. The doubly-shaded regions are earnings dead zones in the baseline and reform, while the more lightly shaded regions are only cliffs in the reform. Because 21GI adds more phase-out (marginal tax rates), it extends existing cliffs, which in this case result from SNAP and reduced price school meals.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3868/1*MUWablXY0CIQ68sPpdlC-g.jpeg)

We can also visualize these cliff and incentive impacts in marginal tax rates. 21GI would raise marginal tax rates for all low-income households. For this household, it will raise it by up to 95 percentage points, at an earnings level where the new payment is phasing out, and the federal/state/local EITCs would all otherwise have phased in, lowering marginal tax rates.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3792/1*zG4Qk5b3B492r3jUonrtZg.jpeg)

Similar to the net income chart above, we can see how 21GI affects total marginal tax rates. This household under 21GI would face marginal tax rates above 70% continuously for most of the earnings range from $13,500 to $49,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3908/1*3OMiseQ87hvfdLXSxd718A.jpeg)

## US-wide impacts

Our static microsimulation model, which applies 2023 tax and benefit rules to the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement, finds the following results.

### Budgetary impact

We project that 21GI would cost [$1.26 trillion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), including the main benefit and the EITC elimination.

This estimate exceeds the New School’s estimate of $876 billion by 43%. This discrepancy could result from multiple factors, including importantly the source dataset and tax filing unit assumption.

While we apply the benefit and phase-out to tax units in the 2021 Current Population Survey, the New School applied it to households in the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances. To the extent that SCF households include multiple tax filing units, it would tend to underestimate the cost by phasing out the benefit for a household whose income would include multiple tax units.

As an example, suppose a 22-year-old, who earns $30,000, lives with their parent, who earns $100,000. 21GI would provide the parent nothing and the child $6,250, half the maximum benefit, given their earnings fall halfway within the $10,000–50,000 phase-out range. But the SCF would show the household as a single tax filing unit with $130,000 income, and thus disqualified from any 21GI benefit.

21GI would alter incentives to file separately; however, neither PolicyEngine nor New School models changing filing behavior as a result.

### Impact by income decile

The reform would [add 11.7% to net incomes](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) overall, and this percentage decreases with income, from 110% at the bottom decile to 0.7% at the top.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3132/1*oD2ReebhMv_OYA5zBWfiyA.jpeg)

### Distributional impacts

21GI would [benefit 60% of the population](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), of whom 97% would gain at least 5% of net income. Over 99% of the bottom fifth would gain, as would 23% of those in the top decile (due to households that comprise multiple filing units).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3120/1*maqbky4pbH-RJX46kvBBnA.jpeg)

### Poverty

Under 21GI, poverty would fall by [94% overall](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and by at least 90% for most subgroups. [Deep poverty would also fall 99%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*whSNdoMuLeXE-bRmDGtilw.jpeg)

### Inequality

21GI would lower income inequality, disproportionately for the broadest measure we report, the Gini index, which would fall 19%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3248/1*wvHl0ybCQYcgyOngym2YJA.jpeg)

### Cliffs

Currently, PolicyEngine estimates that 0.6% of households face a cliff, by which an additional $2,000 of earnings per adult would make the household financially worse off. We expect that this underestimates the prevalence of cliffs, since we have not yet modeled all tax and benefit programs that would increase marginal tax rates or introduce explicit cliffs.

As a result of 21GI’s additional marginal tax rates, that rate of [cliffs would rise 466% to 3.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (one in 30 households). The total lost income from those facing cliffs would also double from $6 billion to $12 billion.

# Analysis of the Working Families Tax Cut Act

Description: How the proposal to increase the standard deduction would affect households and society.

---

On Tuesday, Representatives Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY-11) and Michelle Steel (R-CA-45) introduced the [Working Families Tax Cut Act (WFTCA](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/malliotakis-steel-lead-legislation-to-provide-tax-relief-to-working-families/)) in the House, proposing a broad tax cut through increasing the federal standard deduction.

The standard deduction (which the [bill](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:f2203ce9-a41a-3a28-8b45-509e0b364e45) renames to _“Guaranteed Deduction”_) reduces taxable income for taxpayers who choose not to itemize their deductions. The proposals would increase it by between $2,000 and $4,000 depending on filing status in 2024 and 2025.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*WkVYnCrwjLgDdnQp)

The bill reduces this additional standard deduction by 5% of adjusted gross income exceeding:

- $200,000 for single and separate filers

- $300,000 for head of household filers

- $400,000 for married and widowed filers

[**See how the Working Families Tax Credit Act would affect you.**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

## Household impacts

Consider a [single filer in New York](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31355) with no itemized deductions other than state income tax. The WFTCA would provide [benefits](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31356) if they earn between $13,851 ($1 above the current standard deduction) and $240,000, with the maximum dollar benefit of $640 at around $200,000 earnings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*dv92M9FKwiIP5zCY)

The WFTCA would reduce the filer’s marginal tax rates by up to -10% in specific earnings ranges, around $15,000 and $60,000. The phase-out then raises [marginal tax rates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31356) by about 1.7% when earning between $200,000 and $240,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*C_DfomXSDdHQWOct)

The WFTCA would affect other filers differently, depending on the marital status, children, and itemized deductions like charitable contributions.

## Budgetary impact

We project that the WFTCA would cost [$50 billion in 2023](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). As comparison, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would cost [$95 billion for 2024/25](https://twitter.com/jbuhl35/status/1666924708967727112), or an average of $47.5 billion in each year (they also provided [distributional analysis](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/working-families-tax-cut-act-june-2023/t23-0061-proposal-increase-standard-deduction)). The American Enterprise Institute, using the open-source [Tax-Calculator microsimulation model](https://taxcalc.pslmodels.org/), estimates that the bill would cost [$43 billion in 2024](https://www.aei.org/economics/flawed-approach-the-working-families-tax-cut-act-as-a-response-to-inflation/).

Both TPC and AEI use the IRS public use file (PUF) rather than the Current Population Survey March Supplement (CPS), as PolicyEngine does. They also project the microdata into future years, while we use the 2021 CPS as-is, overwriting taxes and benefits with 2023 policy rules. We will [integrate the PUF into the CPS and project it to future years](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) in the coming months.

In New York and California, the states the authors represent, the bill would reduce tax liabilities by [$3 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=ny&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [$6 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=14512&region=ca&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), respectively.

## Distributional impact

On average, the proposal would raise net incomes by [$382 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2); this increases with income, except for the 10th decile due to the phase-out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2884/0*gheY-rtEMwYZBSAt)

On a [relative basis](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), the bill would raise incomes a similar amount for deciles four through nine.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2732/0*HuuthcudLSRD2551)

We estimate that the WFTCA would benefit [75% of the population](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately those in deciles five through nine. As context, Representative Steel claimed in her announcement that the bill would benefit [82% of tax filers in her district](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/malliotakis-steel-lead-legislation-to-provide-tax-relief-to-working-families/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2712/0*uK_cr-x6857z88-F)

The WFTCA would [lower poverty by 0.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately for working-age adults and [Hispanics](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

The proposal would [lower income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) according to the three measures we estimate. It reduces the broadest measure, the Gini index, the least, and the narrowest, the share held by the top 1%, the most.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2756/0*B_gr7YmtNKBXJshQ)

As a result of lowering marginal tax rates for low-income households, the WFTCA would [make cliffs about 1 percent less prevalent](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=14512&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

# Unveiling poverty impacts by race and ethnicity
Slug: poverty-race-ethnicity
Date: 2023-06-19 20:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, technical
Description: A new feature from PolicyEngine reveals how customizable tax and benefit reforms affect poverty rates for Black, White, Hispanic, and other Americans.

---

As we observe Juneteenth, a day that marks the end of slavery in the United States, PolicyEngine sheds new light on the complex issue of poverty with new capacity to compute impact by race and ethnicity.

## Current poverty rates: a racial and ethnic breakdown

In our commitment to bring transparency to the impact of public policies, we’re excited to extend PolicyEngine to include racial and ethnic breakdowns, supplementing our existing age and [sex](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/breaking-down-us-poverty-impacts-by-sex) analyses.

To provide a comprehensive perspective, we use the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) in our evaluations. This measure goes beyond the traditional Official Poverty Measure (OPM) by accounting for variables such as taxes, in-kind benefits, local housing costs, among others.

Applying current law to the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement, we estimate that 8.8% of the population currently falls below their SPM poverty threshold. However, this figure diverges significantly when examined through the lens of race and ethnicity, revealing the following rates of poverty:

- 6.1% for White non-Hispanic individuals

- 10.9% for Other non-Hispanic individuals

- 12.2% for Hispanic individuals

- 15.0% for Black non-Hispanic individuals

## Policy reforms through a racial and ethnic lens

To illustrate these new capabilities, consider the example of a [universal basic income of $100 per month](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=15208&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). Our analysis reveals that this reform would lower the SPM poverty rate by 24%, with a more pronounced effect among Black and Hispanic Americans.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2876/0*ZjUKWl8gUE0jKxVT)

## Towards inclusive policymaking

This additional feature to our tax and benefit reform calculator enables policymakers, researchers, and advocates to better assess how public policies influence poverty rates across various racial and ethnic groups.

As we commemorate Juneteenth, we recognize the existing racial and ethnic disparities in poverty rates, and encourage those shaping public policy to consider how impacts on these disparities align to societal values.

# Scott Winship's individualized Earned Income Tax Credit proposal
Slug: winship-individualized-eitc
Date: 2023-07-14 08:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis
Tags: us, policy, featured
Description: An analysis and note on the value of open-source models.

---

On Monday, Scott Winship, senior fellow and the director of the Center on Opportunity and Social Mobility at the American Enterprise Institute, published [“Reforming the EITC to Reduce Single Parenthood and Ease Work-Family Balance”](https://ifstudies.org/blog/reforming-the-eitc-to-reduce-single-parenthood-and-ease-work-family-balance) for the Institute for Family Studies. The blog proposed a set of reforms to the Earned Income Tax Credit, most notably basing eligibility on individual rather than joint earnings for married earners. It would also limit EITC eligibility to filers with combined income below $100,000. This report reviews the individual, budgetary, and distributional impacts of that reform using PolicyEngine.

[**_See how an individualized EITC would affect you._**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

## EITC marriage incentives

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit based, as all other federal income tax programs are, on a filer’s total income, including the combined income of spouses for joint filers. The credit increases with the number of children (up to three), phases in with respect to total earned income, and phases out with respect to adjusted gross income.

The structure of the EITC can create a marriage penalty for some people. A marriage penalty occurs when a couple’s total tax bill as a result of getting married exceeds what it would be if they were single and filing individually. As Winship notes:

> Consider an unmarried couple, in which one partner with two children makes $20,000 per year and the other (childless) partner makes $30,000 per year. Under current policy, while they remain unmarried, the parent gets a $6,604 EITC benefit, so their combined income is $56,604. If they get married, their EITC drops to $1,991 because the couple’s income is relatively high and the benefit phases out. They are worse off by $4,613.

PolicyEngine confirms these results, and also provides total net income after taxes and benefits. Table 1 illustrates how this penalty would work for a couple in Texas.

**Table 1: EITC and net income for a sample household under current law**

| Household                                                                                                                                | EITC   | Net income |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| [Single parent of two, $20,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32119)   | $6,604 | $35,073    |
| [Single person, no kids, $30,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32120) | $0     | $25,987    |
| Total if unmarried                                                                                                                       | $6,604 | $61,060    |
| [Married parents of two, $50,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32121) | $1,998 | $51,600    |
| Marriage penalty                                                                                                                         | $4,606 | $9,460     |

The EITC therefore contributes about half of the total marriage penalty faced by this couple, with other tax and benefit provisions contributing the other half. If they marry, they will lose $9,460, or 15% of their net income if unmarried.

## Individualizing the EITC

Winship proposes basing the EITC on individual earnings to reduce these marriage penalties. Specifically, his proposal applies the same EITC structure to married individuals, based on their number of kids and treating them as married, but phasing it in and out with respect to individual earnings. He also limits the credit to filers with combined adjusted gross income below $100,000.

Returning to the previous household (if married), they would see their EITC rise by $10,816. As a result, they would now face a marriage bonus of $1,356 (2%), including a $6,210 marriage bonus from the EITC, most of which is offset by a marriage penalty from other tax and benefit programs.

**Table 2: EITC and net income for a sample household under Winship’s individualized EITC**

| Household                                                                                                                                                                                  | EITC    | Net income |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| [Single parent of two, $20,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32119&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=17331)   | $6,604  | $35,073    |
| [Single person, no kids, $30,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32120&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=17331) | $0      | $25,987    |
| Total if unmarried                                                                                                                                                                         | $6,604  | $61,060    |
| [Married parents of two, $50,000 earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=32121&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&reform=17331) | $12,814 | $62,416    |
| Marriage penalty                                                                                                                                                                           | -$6,210 | -$1,356    |

We can also examine the “shape” of the reform by [varying the head’s earnings](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=32055), holding the spouse’s earnings constant at $20,000.

Under current law (gray), the head starts on the “plateau” of the EITC due to their spouse’s earnings. As they earn more, they get no additional EITC, and then it phases out. In the reform (blue), their spouse’s EITC is constant, and their own EITC stacks atop it until it fully phases around $59,000 earnings. When the head earns $80,000, they hit the $100,000 AGI cap, and both the head and spouse lose their EITC, creating a [cliff](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3040/0*0EhFGZyfMcDJ5bi5)

The difference between these lines indicates the net effect of the reform. For someone with two children whose spouse earns $20,000, the reform would provide the maximum benefit of $10,816 if they earn between $28,500 and $39,500.

## Nationwide impacts

PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model estimates budgetary and distributional impacts of policy reforms. The model runs over the Current Population Survey and is static: it does not assume any behavioral effects with respect to labor supply, marriage, child development, fertility, economic growth, or other factors. The model finds that Winship’s reform would:

- [Cost $38.2 billion in 2023](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Benefit 13% of the population](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Lower poverty by 0.7% and child poverty by 1.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), [disproportionately among Hispanic Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Lower deep poverty by 0.4% and deep child poverty by 0.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

- [Increase the share of households facing cliffs by 16%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)[^1]

[^1]: Winship shared with me that he intended for legislative staff to shift the cliff to a phase-out.

[Households in the fifth income decile](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) would gain the largest share of their income, at 1.4%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*dt4R1nm9QxO11v28)

[The reform would benefit 13% of Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and 8% of Americans would see their net income rise at least 5% (dark green). Gains are most concentrated in the fifth income decile, 29% of whom would benefit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*gSnAHg8M-S9Hxhv1)

## Differences from Winship’s initial (now revised) estimate

When Winship first released his blog post, he estimated that the reform would cost $155 billion from 2024 to 2033, citing his colleague Bodi Yang. Yang produced this estimate in a [notebook](https://github.com/bodiyang/EITC-reform/blob/cbd79625b2fad708b8dbfc8768bcc73135ec1007/eitc_reform.ipynb) that estimated a $13.2 billion cost in 2023, allowing for a direct comparison to PolicyEngine, which currently estimates impacts in 2023 only.[^2] After we successfully investigated the discrepancy between this figure and our higher one, he revised the post and [credited us](https://twitter.com/swinshi/status/1678746851330105345) for the research. We found the issue subtle and the case study instructive.

[^2]: Winship and Yang did not report distributional impacts.

To produce this cost estimate, Winship ran the open source Tax-Calculator microsimulation model over the IRS Public Use File (PUF). As a sample of tax returns, analysts generally regard the PUF as a more accurate source of income data than the CPS — and we are currently [incorporating that information into our data](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis). However, the PUF lacks information on each spouse’s earnings, since filers only need to report the combined total on tax forms. To fill this gap, the Tax-Calculator project determines the average split of income between filer and spouse from the CPS, and applies that equally to PUF records.

PolicyEngine instead uses the CPS directly, where respondents report the income of each person separately. As a result, we capture the diversity of couples with respect to spousal earnings splits. Because this reform disproportionately affects those with large earnings differences between spouses, this difference is material. We believe our $38 billion estimate is more accurate, because it uses income splits directly from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

We shared our findings with Winship the day he released the report, and the next day he corrected it to use the Tax-Calculator CPS data, crediting our find. Winship now reports a $395 billion cost from 2024 to 2033, and Yang’s notebook shows a $43 billion cost in 2023.

This instance taught three lessons in our view:

1. **Open source models facilitate better policy analysis.** We were only able to diagnose the discrepancy because the [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/calcfunctions.py#L2327) and [Tax-Data](https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata/blob/master/taxdata/puf/finalprep.py#L219) code are publicly available on GitHub, as was AEI analyst Bodi Yang’s [code](https://github.com/bodiyang/EITC-reform/tree/main) that produced the estimates. Those who have identified opportunities to improve our own open source software have improved our policy analysis as well.

1. **The Current Population Survey outperforms the IRS Public Use File for some policy questions.** We use the CPS to capture personal relationships within a household, benefit receipt, poverty, and other factors absent from the sample of tax returns in the IRS Public Use File. This comes at a cost: the CPS truncates income more than the PUF, has more measurement error, and lacks some characteristics like specific deductions. We will address those deficiencies by [integrating the datasets](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) later this year, but in the meantime, this analysis revealed a particular research question where the CPS can outperform the PUF.

1. **Stochastic imputations produce more realistic data.** If Tax-Data applied a stochastic technique, such as [quantile regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/quantile-regression-from-linear-models-to-trees-to-deep-learning-af3738b527c3), it would have produced greater spread of the spousal earnings share, compared to the constant approach. When we integrate PUF information into the CPS, we will do so using the [survey-enhance](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/survey-enhance) software package we developed to combine the accuracy of machine learning with the stochasticity of quantile regression ([here’s our working paper](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/survey-enhance/blob/main/docs/paper/project_paper.pdf)).

Scott Winship’s EITC reform proposal would directionally achieve its goal of reducing marriage penalties — even shifting some into marriage bonuses — though we have yet to estimate the aggregate impact on marriage incentives. It would also cost about $40 billion in 2023, reduce poverty and inequality, and make cliffs more prevalent.

We’re grateful to Winship and Yang for their collaborative spirit in identifying and resolving a subtle data issue that resulted in significant deviations across datasets, and look forward to further collaborations with open source models to improve the quality and reproducibility of policy analysis.

# Dive Into New Mexico's Income Tax Analysis on PolicyEngine

Description: Expanding our tax calculator and reform simulator capabilities to the Land of Enchantment.

---

_We’re grateful to the [**Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity**](https://fundforhumanity.org/), which funded the development of this PolicyEngine feature and report._

Today we’ve added New Mexico income taxes to PolicyEngine, enabling any New Mexican to estimate their own income taxes, as well as to design a state tax policy reform and see how it affects their household and the state overall. Here we describe New Mexico’s tax system and show it in action.

## New Mexico’s income tax

New Mexico uses a progressive tax system on individual income, meaning the tax rate increases with higher income, peaking at 5.9%. To calculate this rate, New Mexico subtracts certain deductions and exemptions from gross income, such as for dependents, medical expenses, Social Security benefits, low- and middle-income earners, blind and aged filers, and people who are 100 years or older. New Mexico additionally follows the federal rules for standard and itemized deductions.

New Mexico also provides several rebates and refundable income tax credits:

- **Earned Income Tax Credit:** 25% of the federal EITC, also including filers age 18–24 without children

- **Child and Dependent Care Credit:** Up to 40% of the federal CDCC

- **Child Tax Credit:** Up to $600 per child

- **Unreimbursed Medical Care Expense Credit:** Up to $2,800 per filer

- **Low income comprehensive tax rebate:** Up to $730 per filer

- **Property tax rebate:** Up to $250 per filer

- **Rebates for 2021 only:** Up to $2,500 per filer ($500 main, $1,000 additional, $1,000 supplemental)

PolicyEngine now models these rules from 2021 to 2023 (as available).

## Example household

To illustrate the New Mexico income tax, consider a single parent with two children, paying $1,000 per month in rent and $500 per month in childcare. If they earn $30,000, they will pay no state income tax and [receive $2,127 from four refundable tax credits](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=33113).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2948/0*GfIZU3Qdmhw82mfM)

This filer would have negative [net state tax liability](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=33113) if they earn $50,000 or less.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3104/0*l58k4e3xc5HUKbBZ)

To show the effect of the state’s income taxes on marginal tax rates, we can abolish New Mexico income taxes (separately as before refundable credits and refundable credits) and swap the baseline and reform. From there, view the [marginal tax rate chart](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=33113&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=22176&reform=2) and select _Difference_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3076/0*wC8StujJOgS34Kj4)

As the filer earns up to $15,000 or so, their state tax credits and rebates phase in, reducing their marginal tax rate by about 10 percentage points. As they phase out up to $55,000 income, the state creates additional marginal tax rates of 10 to 15 percentage points, before it stabilizes around the statutory rate of 5 to 6 percent.

## Aggregate impact of New Mexico state income taxes

Simulating over the 2021 Current Population Survey, and reversing the abolition of New Mexico taxes, we can estimate the impact of New Mexico’s state income taxes. PolicyEngine estimates that the full system:

- [Raises $1.3 billion per year](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=nm&timePeriod=2023&baseline=22000)

- [Benefits 41% of New Mexicans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&household=32970&region=nm&timePeriod=2023&baseline=21992&reform=2), including 96% of those in the bottom income decile and 0% in the top income decile

- Lowers the Gini index of [income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&household=32970&region=nm&timePeriod=2023&baseline=21992&reform=2) by 3.6%

- Has no discernible impact on [poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=nm&timePeriod=2023&baseline=22000) or [cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=2&region=nm&timePeriod=2023&baseline=22000)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3064/1*mT4JTaCi2c6PT1eIG69epg.png)

These estimates may not align with official government figures, given inaccuracies and gaps in the Current Population Survey. For instance, the CPS does not capture incomes above $1 million, which could deflate tax revenues, though it also does not capture rent or property tax, which could work in the opposite direction via New Mexico’s property tax rebate. We are currently working to [fill these gaps with modern data analytics](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis).

# Preliminary analysis of the Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit expansion

Politico’s Benjamin Guggenheim [reported today](https://twitter.com/ben_guggenheim/status/1745403401695908256) that Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) are proposing a multifaceted reform to the Child Tax Credit (CTC). This report analyzes two of the three provisions of that reform: raising the maximum refundable CTC amount, and phasing in the refundable CTC with respect to the number of children. We illustrate how this affects a sample household and estimate its impact on society.

From 2023 to 2025 — in our static model assuming full take-up — we project these provisions would:

- Cost $16.4 billion, owing mostly to the more rapid phase-in rate

- Lower poverty by about 1% and child poverty by about 4%

- Benefit 6% of the population

- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.2%

[**_Click here to see how the Wyden-Smith proposal would affect your own household’s 2023 taxes._**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

## How Wyden-Smith Would Reform the Child Tax Credit

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the United States consists of two parts: the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) established the ACTC at $1,400 and the core CTC at $2,000 per child. The ACTC is indexed to inflation, which led to its increase to $1,600 by 2023 and $1,700 in 2024. The refundable portion of the CTC (ACTC) is available to families with earnings, phasing in at a rate of 15% of earnings above a certain threshold.

Guggenheim reported that the Wyden-Smith reform includes three parts:

1. **Raising the refundable CTC amount:** The maximum ACTC would rise from $1,600 to $1,800 in 2023, from $1,700 to $1,900 in 2024, and from $1,700 to the full $2,000 in 2025, with the amount indexed to inflation thereafter.

1. **Phasing in the refundable CTC with the number of children:** Rather than a flat 15% phase-in rate, the CTC would phase in at 15% times the number of qualifying children.

1. **Allowing prior years’ income to count toward the CTC calculation:** Guggenheim did not provide further detail on this provision, nor is PolicyEngine currently equipped to model it, given we use cross-sectional survey and tax data for our projections.

As the TCJA is set to expire after 2025, including its CTC expansion provisions, it is unclear what this proposal would do beyond 2025, so we constrain our analysis to 2023–2025, and focus on 2023 for illustrative examples.

## Impact on a Household

Shortly after Guggenheim reported the reform, Sharon Parrott, President of the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/), [tweeted an example](https://twitter.com/ParrottCBPP/status/1745497766137053289): “A mom w/ 2 kids who earns $15k wld get a $3600 #CTC in ’23, up from $1,875 under current law.” PolicyEngine reproduces that example, showing they [gain $1,725](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=39725). Rather than being partly phased in to the $3,200 ACTC ($1,600 for each of two children), the faster phase-in (30% instead of 15%) brings them all the way up to the $3,600 ACTC.

**Figure 1: Refundable Child Tax Credit with respect to earnings for a single parent of two children, under current law and the Wyden-Smith reform proposal.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2084/0*bV6_hQkfJ4Oq4TMK)

This earnings level is where nearly the peak benefit occurs for this family: if they earned $14,500, they would gain a full $1,800. They will benefit if their earnings range from $2,500 to $29,000.

**Figure 2: Impact of Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal on the net income of a single parent of two children.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2072/0*bO4aeUdIBSTe9cGQ)

The reform would lower the household’s marginal tax rate by 15 percentage points where the ACTC phases in faster, then raise it by 15 percentage points where it stabilizes instead of previously continuing to phase in, then raise it by 10 percentage points where it begins to interact with the non-refundable CTC.

## Societal Impact

Applying our static tax-benefit microsimulation model over the 2022 Current Population Survey, we estimate that these two provisions would cost $5.1 billion in 2023, $5.5 billion in 2024, and $5.9 billion in 2024, for a total three-year cost of $16.4 billion.

Breaking this down between the provisions reveals that they amplify each other: summed separately, they total $4.1 billion, but together they cost $5.1 billion, since the faster phase-in rate goes further when the maximum is higher.

Households in the third income decile benefit most on both an [absolute](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [relative](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) basis. They benefit more than lower income households who have fewer children and don’t meet the earnings requirement, and more than higher income households who take the non-refundable CTC instead.

**Figure 4: Impact of Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal by income decile.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2580/0*ZO7CVih4HQQ6BiN4)

These provisions [benefit 6.4% of US residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2): 2.3% who gain at least 5% of net income, and 4.1% who gain less. Again, the prevalence of gains concentrates in the third income decile.

**Figure 5: Population share gaining from Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal by income decile.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2564/0*buBusyS9y4OmYCjA)

The number of people with resources below the poverty line would fall 1.3%, disproportionately [children](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (4.3%), [Hispanics](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (2.4%), and [men](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (1.5%). The number of children in deep poverty would also [fall 0.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and the Gini index of income inequality would [fall 0.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

Results are similar in 2024 and 2025, with child poverty falling by 3.8% or 3.9%, rather than 4.3%.

## Conclusion

Wyden and Smith have proposed a three-part expansion to the Child Tax Credit, of which PolicyEngine can currently model two. Firstly, it raises the maximum refundable ACTC amount incrementally from 2023 to 2025; secondly, it modifies the phase-in rate of the refundable CTC to be a function of the number of qualifying children; and thirdly, it includes a provision to allow the CTC calculation to be based on prior years’ income, a feature not currently supported.

The estimated impacts of the first two provisions on households include adjustments in the Child Tax Credit received at various income levels; for instance, a single parent of two would benefit if their earnings range from $2,500 to $29,000. These changes also influence marginal tax rates due to the modified phase-in rate of the ACTC.

From 2023 to 2025, the first two provisions would cost $16.4 billion, cut child poverty about 4%, benefit about 6% of Americans, and reduce deep poverty and income inequality. These impacts are relatively stable across the three years, and we do not project further due to the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act after 2025.

As negotiations proceed, we will continue to develop our software platform to support a range of Child Tax Credit analyses, including those like the third provision to base the credit on prior years’ income (which also require further definition). Stay tuned and [**check out our personalized calculator**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) to see how the reform would affect you.

# Beta-launch: PolicyEngine's enhanced microdata for policy analysis

Description: By integrating and calibrating multiple datasets, PolicyEngine makes world-class tax-benefit microsimulation modeling available to anyone.

---

When policy analysts predict the effects of tax and benefit reforms, they often turn to microsimulation. By combining a rules engine with representative survey or administrative datasets, microsimulation supports intricate policy analysis at a detailed household level. Think TurboTax, but for hundreds of thousands of households at once, and over a range of policy rule scenarios. This technology is at the heart of tax-benefit analysis around the world—including PolicyEngine's.

Microsimulation's first ingredient is a robust rules engine. Here, PolicyEngine is well proven, with a detailed federal income tax model, state income tax models complete and [validated](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/993) against [NBER's TAXSIM](https://www.nber.org/research/data/taxsim) in nearly every state, and benefit program models powering [multiple benefit](https://myfriendben.org) [navigation apps](https://imaginela.org/social-benefit) via our API, we provide comprehensive, well-tested rules for most major programs affecting Americans' pocket books.

Today, we're beta-launching a significant upgrade to the second ingredient. Since [December 2022](enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis), we've been building an enhanced open dataset for more accurate microsimulation. While other prominent analysts also enhance microdata, we're taking a different approach that leverages the best of modern data science to support our broad scope of taxes and benefits, at the federal, state and local levels. By starting with the (openly available) Current Population Survey and integrating non-identifiable information from tax records, we are also introducing the first open alternative to restricted tax microdata for microsimulation.

Our launch accompanies three topical reports leveraging the new data:

1. [Child Tax Credit provisions of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act](trafwa-ctc) (PolicyEngine)
1. [Individual income tax provisions of President Biden's 2025 Budget](biden-budget-2025) (PolicyEngine)
1. [Building a stronger foundation for American families: Options for Child Tax Credit reform](https://www.niskanencenter.org/building-a-stronger-foundation-for-american-families-options-for-child-tax-credit-reform/) (Niskanen Center)

This blog post lays out our approach, results from our validation dashboard, and our plans to further advance the field. We've also included information on how to use this free, open-source dataset in your own work, either via the PolicyEngine web app or locally.

## Motivation

PolicyEngine's broad policy scope creates special opportunities and challenges for microdata. Federal tax analysts like the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Foundation have generally focused on data to support federal tax reform. Here, open resources like [Quantria Strategies' technical documentation](https://quantria.com/assets/img/TechnicalDocumentationV4-2.pdf) and the [Policy Simulation Library's open-source Tax-Data project](https://pslmodels.github.io/taxdata/) have served an essential role, documenting and demonstrating how to calibrate datasets of tax returns to best represent the national landscape, and how to construct and integrate nonfilers from surveys to capture reforms that could make them liable for tax or eligible for refundable credits.

Adding benefit programs and state taxes to the model, and reporting on other outcomes like poverty, requires a different approach. Tax returns lack the detailed person-level characteristics, hierarchical data structures, and information on benefits needed to capture the impacts of these programs. For example, Maryland limits its state Child Tax Credit to children under six, or those under age 17 with a disability—an intersection of signals not available in tax returns.

After introducing this approach to microdata enhancement to PolicyEngine UK [over two years ago](../../uk/research/how-machine-learning-tools-make-policyengine-more-accurate), we've refined it and adapted it to the (much more complex) US context. We're excited to have it ready for use and further advances.

## Methodology

We construct our enhanced data, which we call the Enhanced Current Population Survey, or ECPS, from three sources:

1. [**Current Population Survey March Supplement (CPS).**](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) The CPS is a monthly nationwide survey that estimates unemployment rates and other key monthly indicators. Each March, the Census Bureau expands the sample and set of questions, to collect more information on the prior year among respondents. The March Supplement, also called the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), powers reports such as official poverty estimates. Census releases the microdata and its results each September, so the latest currently available represents calendar year 2022. The data is hierarchical, with entities for people, families, tax filing units, households, and "SPM units", referring to the Supplemental Poverty Measure and representing groups of cohabitating individuals who share resources. The 2022 ASEC includes 146,133 people across 88,978 households.
2. [**Internal Revenue Service Public Use File (PUF).**](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-public-use-microdata-files) The IRS makes a flat dataset with information on a sample of tax returns available to researchers who pay a fee and agree not to distribute the data. The most recent PUF represents tax year 2015, with [179 characteristics for 207,696 records](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_SeKv9cmWJW-blALlSgl53yg3UUYzHE/view?usp=sharing), statistically altered to avoid disclosure. From 2016 forward, the IRS will instead release a [synthetic PUF, in partnership with the Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/synthetic-supplemental-public-use-file-low-income-information-return-data-methodology-utility-and-privacy-implications).
3. **Administrative totals.** For instance, the total US population, income tax revenue, dividends, SNAP benefits, and so on. We collect 92 of these from historical sources and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts.

Our procedure maps to the above sequence. As shown in Figure 1 ([high resolution](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1DMExtIYWJMzn2Dii_S9eWXyuGsEtr_7JDl_vfU9F4IY/preview)), we first "age" the CPS and PUF to the current year (e.g., by growing PUF wages by the average growth of wages since 2015), then incorporate information from the PUF onto the CPS (while also preserving the original CPS), and finally reweighting the data. This contrasts to the standard approach among tax analysts: similarly age the CPS and PUF, but use the PUF as a base file, append nonfilers from the CPS, then reweight.

![Figure 1: PolicyEngine's data flow to create PUF-enhanced CPS file](/images/posts/enhanced_cps_beta/data_hierarchy.png)

Specifically, here are our steps:

##### Prepare PUF for training:

1.  Select common variables: demographics, filing status, number of child dependents, and number of other dependents (NB: IRS caps dependent counts at 3 in PUF).
1.  Impute PUF demographics from the 119,675 records with demographics to all 207,696 PUF records using quantile regression forests.

##### Create PUF-structured CPS file:

1.  Aggregate CPS to tax unit to create a dataset with all common variables (includes transformations like capping dependent counts at 3).
1.  Impute PUF variables to PUF-structured CPS file using quantile regression forests.
1.  Break down the PUF-imputed CPS tax unit file by person.
1.  Attach other CPS characteristics to the PUF-structure.
1.  Stack the PUF-based CPS with the original.

##### Reweight with gradient descent:

1.  Calculate the deviation between the dataset's aggregates and administrative totals for each of 90 targets (population, income component, benefit participation, etc.).
1.  Construct a "loss function" that condenses these individual deviations into a single metric.
1.  Apply gradient descent to iteratively adjust the household weights to minimize the loss function.

We've built a new open-source Python package, [`survey-enhance`](https://policyengine.github.io/survey-enhance/), to streamline the usage of quantile regression forests for integration and gradient descent for reweighting. We have also submitted a [paper](https://github.com/nikhilwoodruff/survey-enhance/blob/main/docs/paper/project_paper.pdf) to the International Journal of Microsimulation describing the methodology in greater detail (in the UK context), and comparing it to standard methods. For instance, we show in a [holdout experiment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E8F7S1Uvfw_3PmpS226Sl1LWV5NBi0CE) that quantile regression forests significantly outperform statistical matching for data integration, and also show that the gradient descent approach outperforms percentile matching when correcting surveys for high-income representation.

## Results

We've assessed our approach chiefly by comparing aggregates against administrative totals. We sum each of our 93x targets in the aged PUF, aged CPS, and ECPS, in 2022 to 2025 (applying our rules engine for computed targets). In almost every target, the ECPS performs best, coming within one percent of every target.

To see how our totals compare, explore our [interactive dashboard](https://policyengine-us-calibration-validation.streamlit.app/) (screenshot below).

![PolicyEngine's calibration dashboard](/images/posts/enhanced_cps_beta/dashboard.png)

We have additionally compared results from reforms, and we will launch a similar dashboard with those comparisons in the future.

## How you can use it

You can use the ECPS in the PolicyEngine web app, in the policyengine-us Python package, or by downloading files.

To use the ECPS in the PolicyEngine web app, run a microsimulation as normal, and then toggle the _Use Enhanced CPS_ switch in the right panel, or bottom on mobile. We will make this the default option after we exit beta, as it has been in PolicyEngine UK since we introduced the enhanced data.

![Enhanced CPS switch](/images/posts/enhanced_cps_beta/app_screenshot.png)

To use the ECPS in the policyengine-us Python package, specify it in the Microsimulation call as follows, then use it as you would otherwise.

```python
ecps = Microsimulation(dataset="enhanced_cps_2024")
```

To download the ECPS, visit the [release page](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/releases/tag/enhanced-cps-2022) and download the h5 file.

## Future development

We've received valuable feedback from many in the economics community throughout the development process, and consider this launch only the beginning. Our plans for future development fall into four broad categories:

1. _More targets and validation._ As of this writing, we have [39 open issues related to calibration](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acalibration), ranging from adding targets to better aligning our definitions to available targets.
1. _Comparison to other models._ For instance, we are currently working with the [Policy Simulation Library](pslmodels.org) to validate this dataset against their PUF-based [TaxData](https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata) project. We are also collecting estimates from other analysts, such as the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office, Tax Policy Center, and ITEP, to compare projected results of reforms.
1. _Integrating more data._ Beyond the CPS and PUF, we would like to integrate information from other sources. For example, assets from the Survey of Consumer Finances would improve our modeling of asset limits in programs like SNAP and SSI; consumption from the Consumer Expenditure Survey would enable modeling of a hypothetical Value Added Tax or carbon tax ([as our UK model has](../../uk/research/how-policyengine-estimates-the-effects-of-uk-carbon-taxes)); and rent expenses from the the American Community Survey would improve our modeling of state rental tax credits.
1. _Finer geographic detail._ Having calibrated our data to the US as a whole, we are equipped to replicate the process for smaller geographies. We will avoid the issues of small sample sizes by reweighting the full nationwide dataset to each local area's administrative targets—starting at the state level, then Congressional district and ultimately state legislative district or other locales.

We are setting new standards in policy simulations and evidence-based policymaking by enhancing the CPS with IRS tax records and reweighting. Our ongoing innovation and transparency align with PolicyEngine's mission to compute the impact of public policy accurately and objectively.

Description: How the Wyden-Smith bipartisan tax package would affect families through 2025.

---

When Politico [reported](https://twitter.com/ben_guggenheim/status/1745403401695908256) the bipartisan tax package on January 11, we provided the [first budgetary and distributional analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research/wyden-smith-ctc) of its main Child Tax Credit (CTC) provisions, that day. Today, we’re expanding that analysis to reflect all CTC provisions in the [Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_tax_relief_for_american_families_and_workers_act_of_2024_technical_summary.pdf) (TRAFWA), which Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) [announced on January 16](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/smith-wyden-announce-agreement-on-tax-framework-to-help-families-and-main-street-businesses/). The House [passed the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024/all-actions) 357–70 on January 31, and it currently sits in the Senate.

From 2023 to 2025 — in our static model assuming full take-up — we project the TRAFWA’s CTC reforms would:

- Cost $40 billion

- Lower child poverty by 4.7% in 2023, rising to 9.5% in 2025

- Benefit 9% of the population in 2023, and about 40% in 2024–25

- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.1% in 2023, rising to 0.3% in 2025

This report describes these results in more detail, both for individual households and society at large. We’ll show the [custom mini-app](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/trafwa-ctc-calculator) we built to capture the multi-year effects of the bill on your own family. This is also the first analysis we’ve published using our Enhanced Current Population Survey, we’ve built to give everyone access to the most accurate tax-benefit microsimulation modeling available — learn more about our launch of this cutting-edge dataset [here](enhanced-cps-beta). We close with a comparison to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s results.

[**Click here**](../trafwa-ctc-calculator) to see how the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act would affect your own household’s Child Tax Credit.

## How the Tax Relief for American Workers and Families Act of 2024 Would Reform the Child Tax Credit

The United States provides the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in two parts: the nonrefundable CTC and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) established the ACTC at $1,400 and set the core CTC at $2,000 per child. While the TCJA did not index the core CTC to inflation, it did index the ACTC, resulting in its rise to $1,600 by 2023 and $1,700 in 2024. The ACTC phases in at 15 cents per dollar of earnings in excess of $2,500.

The TRAFWA makes four changes to the CTC:

1. **Raising the ACTC, starting in 2023:** The maximum ACTC would rise from $1,600 to $1,800 in 2023, from $1,700 to $1,900 in 2024, and from $1,700 to the value of the full CTC in 2025. If inflation follows the Congressional Budget Office’s projections, the ACTC will rise to $2,100 in 2025 (see provision 4 below).

1. **Phasing in the ACTC with the number of children, starting in 2023:** The ACTC would phase in at 15 cents multiplied by the number of CTC-eligible children, for each dollar of earnings above $2,500.

1. **Calculating the ACTC from the greater of earnings in the current and prior year, starting in 2024:** Filers who earn more in 2023 than 2024 will be eligible for the ACTC based on 2023 earnings, and similarly for those who earn more in 2024 than 2025.

1. **Inflation-indexing the CTC, rounded down to the nearest $100, starting in 2024:** This will increase the CTC to $2,100 in 2024, and unless inflation significantly outpaces CBO projections, it will remain at $2,100 in 2025.

## Impact on a Household

In our [previous report](https://policyengine.org/us/research/wyden-smith-ctc), we showed how the TRAFWA would affect a single parent of two in 2023. That analysis still holds, so here we’ll show a more complex example: a married family with three children, in 2025, with $10,000 of earnings in 2024. This household would be affected by all TRAWFA CTC reforms: the refundability rise, phase-in rate, inflation adjustment, and lookback provision.

Before getting into the analytics, let’s plug this household into our [new TRAFWA calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/trafwa-ctc-calculator). This tool lets you plug in a few pieces of information to see how the bill would affect you (we don’t collect any personally identifiable information). Let’s suppose they earned $30,000 in 2023, $10,000 in 2024, and $0 in 2025.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*-TiVkn4xxhEmM812)

After clicking **Calculate**, we can see that they gain $9,225 total. $7,950 of that comes in 2024 and 2025, largely due to the lookback provision, though they also gain from other provisions in each year.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*iirHzRPbLja-E4Yk)

Now let’s return to the main app for deeper analytics. If this family has [no earned income in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256), they would be ineligible for any credit under current law. However, TRAFWA would make them eligible for an ACTC phasing in at 45% (15% times three children) of earnings in excess of $2,500, based on their $10,000 of 2024 earnings, up to a maximum of $6,300 ($2,100 for each of three children). That’s 45% of $7,500, or $3,375, which is below the cap.

TRAFWA would affect this family differently [depending on their earnings in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256). Under current law (gray), their ACTC phases in beginning at $2,500, up to a maximum of $5,100 when their earnings reach $36,500. Under TRAFWA, they receive $3,375 until their 2025 earnings exceed their 2024 earnings, at which point it phases in at 45% before reaching $6,300. The non-refundable CTC then displaces the ACTC at higher earnings in both scenarios.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2940/0*fkV9Z2PdXtG6FUxI)

The [net effect](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256) is a gain of up to $4,200 at $16,500 earnings, stabilizing at $300 from the inflation adjustment only at $38,500 earnings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2912/0*1-gBRdTFzk20GBj1)

## Societal Impact

Using PolicyEngine US v0.717.0 project that the TRAFWA CTC would cost $39.8 billion over the three years, with the cost rising each year. Appendix A compares the cost by year and provision to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Here we otherwise focus on 2024 impacts; to see other years, you can click the links and change the year in the right menu.

In 2024, households in the third income decile benefit most on an [absolute](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) basis, while those in the second decile benefit most on a [relative](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) basis. They benefit more than lower income households who have fewer children and don’t meet the earnings requirement, and more than higher income households who take the non-refundable CTC instead.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*KYmHcVBQHNKS2M8f)

These provisions would [benefit 40% of US residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) in 2024. 4% of Americans gain at least 5% of net income, disproportionately those in the bottom four deciles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*fCLAKxRJJbob4GOV)

The number of people with resources below the poverty line would fall 2.0%, disproportionately [children](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (6.9%), [Blacks](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (3.6%), and [women](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (2.2%). We project that the bill would reduce the [number of children in poverty](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CApzPOg-qXbvYPdwmp0gIPK__kffixQH?authuser=1#scrollTo=OqtYayw8YNhu) by 345,000 in 2023, 573,000 in 2024, and 740,000 in 2025.[^1] Deep child poverty would [fall 6.1%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2), and the Gini index of income inequality would [fall 0.25%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

[^1]: The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [forecasted](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/about-16-million-children-in-low-income-families-would-gain-in-first-year-of) that "In the first year, the expansion would lift as many as 400,000 children above the poverty line. [...] When the expansion is fully in effect, it would lift some 500,000 or more children above the poverty line."

## Conclusion

As the Senate considers the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, we present a new analysis into the budgetary, household, and distributional impacts it would generate. We do so using a new calculator, and a new dataset tuned for accurate policy forecasting, which we will continue to develop for greater accuracy in the future. Like all forecasts, ours carry uncertainty; for instance, our assumptions around full take-up and zero behavioral responses may not fully reflect reality, and future model enhancements will provide more flexible assumptions on these points.

## Appendix A: Comparison to the Joint Committee on Taxation

The Joint Committee on Taxation expanded upon their official score in [this letter](https://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/118-0673.pdf), which includes methodology and a provision-by-provision budgetary breakdown (they did not provide distributional impacts). They estimate the CTC provision cost $33.6 billion over the three years, while we estimate $39.8 billion, 18% higher.

As shown in the table below, major differences include:

1. PolicyEngine assumes the $2,000 CTC rises to $2,100 in 2024; JCT assumes 2025. This is based on [PolicyEngine’s research into the law and C-CPI-U values](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/discussions/3726), and aligns with the Tax Foundation’s interpretation.

1. PolicyEngine finds a substantially larger impact of the lookback provision. We [build a panel from the 2018 and 2019 ASEC files](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/methodology/How%20To%20Link%20CPS%20Public%20Use%20Files.pdf), limiting to those who responded to employment and self-employment income questions, then build a quantile regression forests model to predict the distribution of prior-year earnings for each person in the CPS. This prediction algorithm adjusts the sampling distribution to match the total employment and self-employment income in the relevant year. Our model uses [these variables](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/blob/1d3ca3ef54e2904a547a1e649b90979aaad0509a/policyengine_us/data/datasets/cps/enhanced_cps/enhanced_cps.py#L57-L71) as predictors. JCT shared with us that the allocation of dependents to tax units within the household likely explains the discrepancy; we have filed [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/4392) to improve our modeling on this front.

Our estimates may also differ due to different data, take-up assumptions (we assume full take-up, including of the lookback provision), and behavioral responses (though JCT said that they project minimal labor supply effects).

To contextualize the higher estimate of the lookback provision, we used the constructed 2018–19 ASEC panel to compare the ACTC amounts between 2018 and 2019 for the same filers. [We found](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NSYogO-uKBeSA7ECz0vDDURVX8LvJrso?usp=sharing) that the greater of 2018 and 2019 ACTC sums to 34% above the 2019 ACTC for filers in the panel (and with reported rather than imputed employment and self-employment incomes). Applying this to the total 2019 ACTC, this suggests that filers would have received an additional $8.3 billion in ACTC payments if they could choose the greater of their 2018 and 2019 payment, though this would have been partly offset by lower non-refundable CTC payments.

# Individual income tax provisions of President Biden's 2025 Budget

Description: PolicyEngine projects the impact of expanding tax credits and raising taxes on high-income filers.

---

President Biden introduced his [2025 Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025/) earlier this month, proposing a mix of reforms to both revenues and outlays. This report applies the PolicyEngine US microsimulation model to analyze four of its main individual income tax reforms:

1. Restoring the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion

1. Restoring the 2021 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for filers without qualifying children

1. Raising the top marginal tax rate to 39.6%

1. Increasing the Medicare and Net Investment Income taxes

We estimate that, in 2024 and assuming no behavioral responses, these reforms would cost $40.5 billion, lower poverty 12%, and lower income inequality. 59% of Americans would see a higher net income, while 3% would see a lower net income. This report describes these impacts in more detail, and examines effects on individual households.

**See how President Biden’s 2025 Budget affects your household with our [personalized calculator.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50893&focus=intro&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2)**

## The reforms

Here we summarize the four provisions of Biden’s 2025 Budget that PolicyEngine models, based on the [Department of the Treasury’s details](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2025.pdf).

### Restoring the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion

Biden’s budget restores the expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). It would make the CTC fully refundable beginning in 2024, and for 2024 and 2025 increase the age limit from 16 to 17. Additionally, it increases the maximum credit per child to $3,600 for children under 6, and $3,000 for older children, phasing out at 5% of income in excess of a threshold dependent on filing status: $150,000 (married joint), $112,500 (head of household), and $75,000 (other). These amounts are not inflation-adjusted.

For example, this reform would provide an additional $3,600 to a single parent of two children, with one below six, if their income is below $6,600. The net benefit would phase out until their earnings reach $164,000, as shown [here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43046).

To learn more, read our [**2023 report on restoring the ARPA CTC.**](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expanded-child-tax-credit)

### Restoring the 2021 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for filers without qualifying children

Biden similarly proposed restoring ARPA’s expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for filers without qualifying children. His plan would:

- Increase the phase-in and phase-out rates from 7.65% to 15.3%

- Lower the minimum age from 25 to 19 (or 24 for students)

- Remove the maximum age, currently 65

- Raise the maximum credit from $632 to $1,749 (adjusted for inflation from 2021)

This would change the EITC [as follows](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50974&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=40437) for a single person between 25 and 65:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3004/0*O92F233Vaga2cfI8)

Producing a net benefit of up to $1,360 at $13,500 earnings, phasing out until earnings reach $25,000.

To learn more, read our [2023 report on restoring the ARPA EITC.](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc)

### Increasing the top marginal rate to 39.6%

The President proposed raising the top marginal tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, its value prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new rate would apply to income above $400,000 for single filers, $425,000 for head of household filers, $450,000 for married filers, and $225,000 for married separate filers. The reform would take effect in 2024, and the thresholds would rise with inflation starting in 2025.

For a [single person](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50882&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43050) without itemized deductions, taxes would begin rising at $414,600 ($400,000 plus the standard deduction), and reach $19,400 in additional taxes at $1 million earnings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2260/0*B4zBerNqDKQtXONc)

### Increasing the Medicare and Net Investment Income taxes

Finally, the President proposed increasing both the top Medicare tax rate and top Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) rate by 1.2 percentage points for individuals with income over $400,000. Since this is based on wages or net investment income, it kicks in at $400,000, not the higher amount resulting from the standard deduction. For an [individual](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50660&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) with $1 million in wages, it would increase their taxes by $7,200.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2268/0*EG5QzaVzXMfuxZ3c)

### Provisions not modeled

The Budget introduces four additional individual income tax reforms that PolicyEngine does not yet model:

1. Applying the NIIT to pass-through business income of taxpayers with income above $400,000

1. Tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as ordinary income for filers with taxable income above $1 million

1. Repeal “step-up basis” that increases the basis of inherited assets to the value at inheritance

1. Impose a minimum tax of 25% on total income (including unrealized capital gains) for taxpayers with wealth exceeding $100 million

Additionally, it reforms some of the programs we model in additional ways, such as a monthly CTC advance, and introduces many reforms outside the individual income tax. As we enhance our model, we will be able to forecast impacts of these types of reforms.

## Combined household impacts

To see the combined impacts of all four reforms on net income and work incentives, we examine two household types: a single person and a married couple with two young children.

### Single person

The [single person](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) would see a larger EITC at low incomes, then a tax increase when their wages exceed $400,000, reaching a $26,600 total impact at $1 million earnings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3152/0*G3krZSBCHVu2Xbwf)

Their [marginal tax rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) would fall up to 20pp in the earnings range where the EITC phases in further, then rise 15.3 percentage points as it phases out. It would then rise by 1.2pp from $400,000 to $414,600 (due to the additional Medicare rate, before the 39.6% rate kicks in), 5.8pp until earnings reach $623,950 (before they reach the current top marginal rate), and stabilize at a 3.8pp rise. The total marginal rate on top earnings would reach 43.2%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3108/0*YxlpJfHqW5R3BIEp)

### Family of four

A [married couple with two children](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43059) under six will gain up to $7,200 from the expanded CTC, until their earnings reach $220,000 (assuming only one earner). Their taxes will then rise beginning at $400,000 earnings, and by $1 million earnings their taxes would rise by $27,500.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3176/0*0IBvj5oF5Jv_cAva)

The reform increases their [marginal tax rate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43059), due to making the CTC fully refundable (removing the phase-in that reduces marginal tax rates), phasing out the additional CTC benefit for higher earners, and the high-income tax increases. The marginal tax rate increase stabilizes at 3.8pp for earnings above $770,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3080/0*vzdISr5GI4VcDmjY)

## Nationwide results

We run the PolicyEngine tax-benefit microsimulation model v0.717.0, using our [Enhanced Current Population Survey](enhanced-cps-beta) and assuming no behavioral responses, to project budgetary and distributional impacts.

These provisions together would cost [$41 billion in 2024](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) and [$35 billion in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), according to the PolicyEngine model. While all provisions grow in magnitude, the tax increases grow faster, resulting in a smaller net impact. See Appendix A for a breakdown by provision and comparison to Treasury’s projections.

The net income of the bottom nine deciles would [rise](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2), on average, while the top decile’s would fall.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*U8PVwgIOPwao0B3a)

As a [percentage](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) of net income, the impact falls monotonically with income decile:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*FYfP1qgE6EF0ojl4)

Three in five Americans would see an [increase](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) in net income, while three percent–almost entirely in the top income decile–would see it fall.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*zUezlVy2vxvAqKqt)

The Supplemental Poverty Measure would fall 12%, disproportionately among [children](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (31%), [women](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (13%), and [Blacks and Hispanics](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (14–15%).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*fPcXYZPC77uYeIZj)

[Deep poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) falls at a similar rate, while [income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) falls 1.7% to 2.7%, depending on the measure.

## Conclusion

President Biden’s proposed individual income tax reforms in his 2025 Budget, as analyzed by PolicyEngine, would have notable impacts on American households and the economy. The restoration of the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit from the American Rescue Plan Act, along with the proposed increases in the top marginal tax rate, Medicare tax, and Net Investment Income Tax, are projected to result in a net cost of approximately $41 billion in 2024 and $35 billion in 2025.

The analysis suggests that the reforms would have a progressive impact on income distribution, with the bottom nine deciles experiencing an average increase in net income, while the top decile would see a decrease. The proposed changes are also projected to reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 12%, with varying impacts across demographic groups. Income inequality would also be affected, with reductions ranging from 1.7% to 2.7%, depending on the measure used.

This analysis does not account for potential behavioral responses to the proposed tax changes, and differs from Treasury’s budgetary estimates for reasons described below (Treasury does not provide distributional estimates). As policymakers and the public consider these reforms, it will be crucial to carefully examine the potential impacts and trade-offs associated with the proposed changes to the individual income tax system.

Due to timing considerations — we place the budgetary impact of tax credits in the tax year, while Treasury does so only when paid in advance, mirroring the delivery of most payments in the following year — the combined impact across years provides more comparable numbers than either year in isolation. Here, Treasury estimates $94.4 billion from 2024–25, while PolicyEngine estimates $75.2 billion. This does not fully account for timing considerations, since Treasury allocates part of our 2025 estimates to 2026.

Other deviations could result from multiple causes. For example, we do not model the provision to apply the NIIT to pass-through business income of high-income filers, which occurs prior to the NIIT increase; accounting for this would thus increase our estimate of that provision. Further calibration of our [microdata](enhanced-cps-beta) to existing costs of programs could also better align these estimates; for example, [to the EITC](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/4276).

# PolicyEngine launches state income tax modeling nationwide
Slug: state-tax-model-beta
Date: 2024-04-15 09:00:00
Authors: Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, policy, featured
Description: Free, open-source platform now covers all 50 states and D.C., just in time for tax season.

---

Today, as tax season closes, PolicyEngine is thrilled to announce the beta launch of state income tax modeling for all 50 states and Washington D.C. This significant milestone expands our existing suite of policy analysis tools, which already includes a comprehensive model of federal income taxes and benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Supplemental Security Income.

## What this means for our users

With this launch, anyone can now use PolicyEngine’s free, open-source platform to:

1. Enter their household information and estimate their state income taxes, along with federal taxes and benefit amounts.

1. Access free analytics, such as how net income and marginal tax rates change with respect to earnings.

1. Design customizable policy reforms for state income taxes and estimate the impact on households and society, including changes to the budget, poverty rates by age, race, and gender, income inequality, the distribution of benefits and costs, and impacts by income decile.

This launch represents a critical step towards our full launch later this year, which will include further enhancements such as:

1. Full validation against the[ National Bureau of Economic Research’s TAXSIM model](https://taxsim.nber.org/feenberg-coutts.pdf) for all states and tax years. We already validate PolicyEngine against TAXSIM for hundreds of thousands of tax units in each state and match to the penny for the [vast majority of cases](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/993) (for the 2021 tax year, TAXSIM’s latest). We’re grateful to be collaborating with Daniel Feenberg, TAXSIM’s creator, and a PolicyEngine advisory board member, to improve both models for the benefit of all users.

1. Adding more recent tax law, including legislation that defines tax rules for 2024 and beyond, as well as future-dated legal changes and inflation adjustments.

1. Allowing users to model how federal reforms affect state taxes, such as states that match a percentage of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.

1. Incorporating this into our federal model of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction by imputing property taxes, the other element of this hotly-debated policy. This means we’ll be able to model real state income tax policies into SALT analysis, rather than reported amounts from prior years’ data.[^1]

[^1]: Currently, for the purposes of the SALT deduction and baseline net income in US simulations, we use state income tax as the Census Bureau calculates it from the Current Population Survey March Supplement, indexed for inflation.

Looking ahead, we also aspire to extend our [recently beta-launched microdata enhancement](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) to the state level, further improving the accuracy of state impact estimates for both state and federal reforms.

# PolicyEngine Powers Niskanen Center's Analysis

Description: Three new reports from the Niskanen Center think tank demonstrate PolicyEngine's tax and benefit reform model.

---

PolicyEngine recently powered three Niskanen Center tax and benefit reforms. Our updated model offers new opportunities to explore both the budgetary and distributional impacts of these proposals on childhood poverty. Niskanen, the first major American think tank to use PolicyEngine, follows in the footsteps of institutions such as The [Centre for Policy Studies](https://cps.org.uk/research/national-insurance-a-plan-to-blunt-the-pain/_) and the [Green Party](https://martin-farley.medium.com/poverty-buster-the-impact-of-the-2019-green-party-manifesto-on-household-incomes-and-equality-9663c39b783b) in the United Kingdom. On issues from the Child Tax Credit (CTC), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), household filing status, and more, PolicyEngine has proven itself a reliable authority on tax and benefit modeling.

The report, "[Building A Stronger Foundation for American Families](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Building-a-stronger-foundation-for-American-families-.pdf)" leverages PolicyEngine's capacity to identify marriage penalties and benefit cliffs. PolicyEngine instantly provided the cost ($110 billion) and poverty impacts (a 31.2 percent child poverty reduction) for Niskanen's baseline case, restoring the American Rescue Plan's CTC expansion. The authors then adjusted key policy levers (we provide thousands) on the platform with the intent to lower cost, reduce marriage penalties, and target specific income deciles.

PolicyEngine's built-in instant interactive data visualizations powerfully illustrate the distributional effects of Niskanen's proposals across income deciles. For example, the chart below unpacks the distributional analysis of two simultaneous reforms–an expansion of the CTC combined with the elimination of the head of household (HoH) filing status, which reduces taxes for single parents compared to single individuals. Policy makers are often looking to find lower costs, and charts like these demonstrate how multivariate changes to the tax-code enable policymakers to balance budgetary concerns with impact. James Medlock, a favorite contributor to online policy discussion, applauded the chart: "Especially for more 'give and take' reforms like this, it's nice to show heterogeneity within deciles," [he wrote](https://x.com/jdcmedlock/status/1772638537059377660).

PolicyEngine also empowers consumers of policy reforms to test the analysis and dig deeper. PolicyEngine's free open source model makes our assumptions transparent and enables anyone to design policy reforms. For example, by clicking [here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=47843&region=enhanced_) you can see all component reforms and impacts of Niskanen's preferred policy design.

Two other recent Niskanen analyses demonstrate PolicyEngine's versatility. The first, on [Virginia's family benefit policy](https://www.niskanencenter.org/options-for-virginia-to-reform-its-family-tax-benefits/), uses PolicyEngine to calculate the cost of state policy. Examining the recent [Commonwealth Kids Credit proposal](https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/research/support-virginia-families-through-a-commonwealth-kids-credit/), PolicyEngine predicts a cost of [$873.8 million per year](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=32868&region=va&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). The second, an [analysis of the recently passed statewide Child Tax Credit in Illinois](https://www.niskanencenter.org/a-missed-opportunity-to-get-illinois-ctc-right/), also uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to predict both costs and impacts. Converting the state's dependent exemption into a fully refundable child tax credit for children under eighteen, [PolicyEngine models](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=57128&region=il&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) a cost of approximately $50 million this year and deep child poverty reduction of 11%. PolicyEngine's sheer speed, when combined with its high level of specificity and customizability, makes it an attractive choice for policy analysts across the political spectrum.

As PolicyEngine grows and improves, institutions like the Niskanen Center can continue their thoughtful analysis in an ever more efficient, intuitive, and user-friendly way. Interested in using PolicyEngine for your own work? Reach out at [hello@policyengine.org](mailto:hello@policyengine.org).

# Kamala Harris's LIFT Act Middle Class Tax Credit
Slug: lift-act

Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk

Description: A comprehensive analysis of the Vice President's 2018 proposal.

---

As a US Senator in 2018, Vice President Kamala Harris introduced the [LIFT (Livable Incomes for Families Today) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4/text), a refundable tax credit similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit. Then-Senator Harris also featured this proposal in her 2020 presidential campaign. Using PolicyEngine US v1.25.2 and the 2022 Enhanced Current Population Survey, we analyze the potential impacts of this reform if implemented in 2024. This analysis focuses solely on the Middle Class Tax Credit (MCTC) component of the LIFT Act, not addressing other provisions such as those related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or a financial transactions tax.

# What is the LIFT Act?

The LIFT Act's Middle Class Tax Credit phases in with 100% of earnings up to a maximum amount, then phases out with adjusted gross income over a window. Harris established it with inflation-indexed values in 2019, which creates the following structure in 2024:

**Table 1: LIFT Act Middle Class Tax Credit parameters (2024)**

| Filing status     | Maximum amount | Phase-out start | Phase-out end |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Single            | $3,600         | $35,800         | $59,650       |
| Head of household | $3,600         | $71,600         | $95,450       |
| Joint             | $7,200         | $71,600         | $119,350      |

This structure is depicted below. You can also calculate how the LIFT Act would affect your own household with **[this calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=61627&focus=intro&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2)**.

![Figure 1: LIFT Act Middle Class Tax Credit by filing status and earnings level (2024)](/images/posts/lift-act/trapezoids.png)

# Static US Impact

[PolicyEngine estimates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=61632&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) that the MCTC would, in 2024:

- Cost $411 billion
- Lower poverty by 25.4%, with larger reductions for children, Blacks, Hispanics, and men
- Reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 4.1%
- Benefit 68% of Americans

![Figure 2: Winners from the LIFT Act Middle Class Tax Credit by Decile (2024)](/images/posts/lift-act/winners.png)

While the earnings requirement reduces the share of individuals in the bottom decile who would benefit, those in the second through sixth deciles gain more than those in higher income households.

# US Impact Considering Behavioral Responses

PolicyEngine now supports behavioral responses: users can enter their own income and substitution elasticities, which govern how people work less when they have more income and are paid less on the margin, respectively. The MCTC would be expected to reduce work through the income effect, and both increase and reduce work through the substitution effect, as it reduces marginal tax rates by 100 percentage points in the phase-in and increases them by 15 percentage points in the phase-out.

Applying elasticities from the Congressional Budget Office, we project that the MCTC would [reduce hours worked by 1.1%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=61633&focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.hours&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) and [earnings by 0.9%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=61633&focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.earnings.overall.relative&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2). Substitution effects (the phase-out) explain most of these reductions. As a result, the tax credit's cost would rise by 10% to [$450 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=61633&focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2), though the poverty impact would remain essentially unchanged at 25%.

# Conclusion

The LIFT Act proposed by then-Senator Kamala Harris includes a Middle Class Tax Credit that would reduce poverty and inequality through over $400 billion in annual transfers if fully taken up. This exceeds contemporaneous cost estimates (see Table 2), likely due to faster than expected inflation since 2018, which mechanically expands the nominal cost of the program through higher maximums and phase-outs. We also assume full take-up, which increases the costs compared to, for example, the Tax Policy Center's assumption of partial take-up.

Incorporating behavioral responses adds about 10% to the cost, due to about 1% less labor supply. This results from income effects and substitution effects for those in the phase-out range, though some low-income earners would be projected to work more due to substitution effects.

As Vice President Harris pursues her 2024 presidential campaign, she may balance her prior proposals like the LIFT Act with newer policies in [President Biden's budget](https://policyengine.org/us/research/biden-budget-2025). PolicyEngine stands ready to support evidence-based evaluation of potential reforms like these and those from across the political spectrum.

# Analysis of JD Vance’s Suggested $5,000 Child Tax Credit Expansion
Slug: vance-ctc
Date: 2024-08-11 01:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk

Description: Impacts of the vice presidential nominee’s reform depend largely on its uncertain refundability.

---

Senator and vice presidential nominee JD Vance (R-OH) has suggested expanding the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to $5,000 per child. His statements suggest he’d also like to remove income limits, while leaving the question of refundability uncertain. Using PolicyEngine, we’ve analyzed two versions of this idea: one maintaining current refundability rules and another making the credit fully refundable.

The version maintaining current refundability would cost $106 billion in 2025 and reduce child poverty by 1%, assuming no behavioral responses. The fully refundable version would cost $241 billion and reduce child poverty by 41%. Applying labor supply [assumptions](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/43674-laborsupplyfiscalpolicy.pdf#page=4) from the Congressional Budget Office lowers the cost of the partially refundable by 8%, while increasing the cost of the fully refundable version by 2%. Both versions would increase disposable income across all income deciles and reduce income inequality.

## Vance’s Statements

In a 2021 [interview](https://abcnews.go.com/US/vance-argued-higher-tax-rate-childless-americans-2021/story?id=112284318) with Charlie Kirk, Vance expressed support for a tax policy favoring families with children: "If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year and you’ve got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don’t have any kids."

Vance spoke about this with Margaret Brennan of Face the Nation in an [interview](https://youtu.be/pK1V2q05Zi8?si=tyJuJ37hV7jPuaZQ) that aired today, including the CTC as an instantiation of his 2021 idea. He then suggested expanding it: "I’d love to see a child tax credit that’s $5,000 per child."

When asked about income limits, Vance added: "I’d like to have a broad-based family policy and a broad-based child tax credit. […] I think you want it to apply to all families. I don’t think that you want this massive cutoff for lower income families, which you have today, you don’t want a different policy for higher income families, you just want to have a pro-family child tax credit."

While not a formal policy proposal, these statements provide insight into his thinking on family tax policy.

## Background on the Child Tax Credit

The current CTC provides up to $2,000 per child, with a partial refundability structure, as our [CTC explainer](https://policyengine.org/us/research/the-child-tax-credit-in-2023) details. Low-income parents who don’t benefit from the $2,000 non-refundable credit can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refundable credit that phases in with earnings above $2,500. The credit then begins to phase out at incomes of $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers. PolicyEngine projects that this phase-out structure will reduce the program’s cost by [$5 billion in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=63060&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), or [$4 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63085&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) accounting for behavioral responses.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*pEOu1VXlahfSP2g8)

The most recent attempt to expand the CTC came in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act (TRAFWA). The House [passed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024/all-actions) this bill 357–70 in January. However, on August 1, the Senate fell short of the votes needed to pass it, with a 48–44 vote; Vance was absent for this vote. We [analyzed](https://policyengine.org/us/research/trafwa-ctc) the potential impacts of TRAFWA in March.

## Household Impacts

Vance’s suggested policy would provide up to $5,000 per child, though specific amounts vary with marital status, income, number of children, and the policy’s refundability.[^repo]

[^repo]: We generated these custom charts with the `policyengine-us` Python package in [this notebook](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/analysis-notebooks/blob/main/us/irs/income/credits/ctc/vance_ctc.ipynb). Other charts we generated with the PolicyEngine web app.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*LozrS5KgfAaq8bVS)

Regardless of refundability, parents with income above certain levels would gain $5,000 per child; for example, a married family with . For low-income parents, the fully refundable version could provide up to $5,000 per child in additional benefits. Otherwise, both versions provide an additional $3,000 per child for most families currently receiving the full $2,000 credit, except those in the phase-in region of the partially-refundable version.

For personalized calculations, you can use our calculators for the version with [current refundability](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63077&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) and [full refundability](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63076&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us).

## Societal Impacts

Applying the PolicyEngine US 1.45.2 microsimulation model and Enhanced CPS data, we project that the CTC expansion would cost $106 billion and $241 billion in 2025 if maintaining or expanding refundability, respectively, while reducing poverty and inequality (we display the Gini index below, though other measures also fall).[^crfb] You can view the full results in PolicyEngine for the [current](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=63077&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) and [full](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63076&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) refundability versions. The below table summarizes these impacts:

[^crfb]: Comparing our budgetary projections to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget's ["Build Your Own Child Tax Credit"](https://www.crfb.org/build-your-own-child-tax-credit) tool, we find similar results with full refundability, but significantly lower results with current refundability. Specifically, their estimates for no full refundability were \$238 billion (CRFB) versus \$106 billion (PolicyEngine), and with full refundability, \$264 billion (CRFB) versus \$241 billion (PolicyEngine). They shared that their estimates do not rely on microsimulation modeling, and could as a result become inaccurate for larger reforms.

| Metric                          | Current refundability | Full refundability |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Cost**                        | $106.3 billion        | $241.5 billion     |
| **Population share benefiting** | 33.4%                 | 46.9%              |
| **Child poverty impact**        | -1.2%                 | -41.9%             |
| **Overall poverty impact**      | -0.4%                 | -12.6%             |
| **Gini impact**                 | -0.4%                 | -2.3%              |

Maintaining current refundability, one in three Americans would benefit from the reform, and one in five would gain at least 5% of their net income. Less than five percent of people in the bottom two deciles would benefit, however, as most do not have income tax for the non-refundable credit to offset.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*r9Vpz-45q2jOvtCP)

Making the credit fully refundable increases the share of Americans who would benefit by 40%, from 33% to 47%. Two in five would also benefit by at least 5% of their net income. All who gain in the bottom seven income deciles would benefit by at least 5%, including 22% in the bottom two deciles (they are less likely to benefit because of lower-income households having fewer children).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*mn0O2wftzVoEa7-W)

## Labor supply responses

The incorporation of labor supply responses based on CBO elasticities reveals differing impacts between the non-refundable and fully refundable versions of the expanded Child Tax Credit. These elasticities capture two mechanisms by which people might work less: they have more money and can purchase leisure (“income effect”) and they take home less for a marginal hour of work (“substitution effect”).

| Version                   | Change in hours worked | Change in earnings | Change in cost |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| **Current refundability** | +0.45%                 | +0.27%             | -8.3%          |
| **Fully refundability**   | -0.25%                 | -0.11%             | +1.7%          |

Without changing refundability, income effects reduce labor supply, but substitution effects from removing the additional 5 percentage point marginal tax rate in the CTC phase-out region dominate, resulting in a net increase in labor supply. [See the full results in PolicyEngine.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63079&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us)

With full refundability, income effects lower labor supply, and substitution effects operate in both directions: lower marginal tax rates from removing the phase-out, but higher marginal tax rates from removing the phase-in. The net effect is lower labor supply from both income and substitution effects, with income effects having a larger impact. [See the full results in PolicyEngine.](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63081&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us)

## Conclusion

JD Vance’s suggestion to expand the Child Tax Credit to $5,000 per child and remove income limits would significantly alter current family tax policy. The impacts vary substantially based on refundability: the fully refundable version would cost 2 to 2.5x as much as the partially refundable version, but would reduce child poverty by 41% compared to 1%.

Both versions would increase disposable income for most families with children and reduce income inequality, with the refundable version providing more substantial benefits to lower-income households.

Labor supply effects differ as well, with the partially refundable version slightly increasing work hours and the fully refundable version slightly decreasing them.

Key areas of uncertainty in this analysis include:

- Take-up rates, especially for the fully refundable version

- Extent of labor supply responses

- Macroeconomic feedback effects beyond labor supply responses, such as deficit impacts

As policymakers consider this and other proposals, tools like PolicyEngine can provide valuable insights into the potential impacts on different households and the overall economy. However, these projections should be considered alongside other evidence and potential long-term consequences to form a comprehensive understanding of the policy’s effects.

- **Session:** [Responses to Income Taxes](https://nta.confex.com/nta/2024/meetingapp.cgi/Session/1234)

### Abstract

In this study, we employ large language models (LLMs) to investigate how these AI systems perceive and simulate behavioral responses to changes in tax policies. By leveraging the economic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's GPT models, we simulate various tax filer scenarios and analyze the LLMs' responses to policy changes, such as modifications to statutory marginal tax rates or the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) phase-in range.

We begin by examining how LLMs perceive and simulate behavioral responses across different tax filer situations, including primary and secondary earners, capital gains income, and single filers with children. For each scenario, we vary household income levels to test for heterogeneity across the income distribution. By comparing the LLMs' simulated responses to empirical estimates from the literature, we assess the alignment between the AI-generated perceptions and real-world observations, highlighting similarities, differences, and potential insights beyond the available literature.

Furthermore, we delve into the "reasoning" behind the LLMs' simulated responses, exploring factors such as income and substitution effects, optimization frictions, and incomplete information. By analyzing the LLMs' explanations, we gain a deeper understanding of how these AI systems perceive and model complex economic decision-making processes.

This study contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted economic research by demonstrating the potential of LLMs to provide novel insights into behavioral responses to tax policy changes, complementing and extending the existing empirical literature. Our findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to leverage AI technologies to inform economic policy decisions and advance our understanding of taxpayer behavior.

## 2. PolicyEngine's Enhanced Current Population Survey for Tax-Benefit Microsimulation

- **Presenters:** Max Ghenis, Co-founder and CEO of PolicyEngine, and Nikhil Woodruff, Co-founder and CTO of PolicyEngine
- **Date and Time:** Thursday, November 14, 2024, 9:30 AM - 9:50 AM
- **Location:** Marquette B (Level 5, Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center)
- **Session:** [Advances in Using Administrative Data to Measure Income Distributions and the Effects of Tax Policies](https://nta.confex.com/nta/2024/meetingapp.cgi/Session/5678)

### Abstract

Microsimulation models are powerful tools for analyzing the effects of tax and benefit reforms. However, constructing representative microdata that supports modeling a broad range of policies at the federal, state, and local levels presents unique challenges. Tax records lack detailed person-level characteristics and benefit information, while survey data may not capture the full distribution across income sources.

In this paper, we introduce PolicyEngine's new enhanced microdata, the Enhanced Current Population Survey (ECPS), which leverages modern data science techniques to address these challenges. We integrate information from the IRS Public Use File into the Current Population Survey March Supplement using quantile regression forests. We then reweight the data using gradient descent to match a comprehensive set of national totals. Our validation results demonstrate that the ECPS outperforms the aged CPS and PUF in matching most administrative aggregates, coming within one percent across hundreds of targets covering demographics, income, benefits, and taxes.

To showcase the ECPS's capabilities, we assess several Child Tax Credit (CTC) reform proposals, finding that it closely reflects budgetary estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, while additionally providing nuanced distributional impacts.

By making this dataset openly available and providing a user-friendly interface for using and evaluating it, we aim to democratize access to high-quality microsimulation for policymakers, researchers, and the public. We discuss our methodology in detail, including the use of our new open-source Python package, survey-enhance, for data integration and reweighting. We also outline our plans for further enhancements, such as incorporating additional data sources, providing finer geographic detail, and expanding our validation efforts through comparisons with other prominent models.

## PolicyEngine Platform Showcase

- **Event:** Poster Session
- **Date and Time:** Friday, November 15, 2024, 5:15 PM - 6:30 PM
- **Presenters:** PolicyEngine Team

In addition to our paper presentations, we're excited to showcase the PolicyEngine platform at the conference's poster session. This will be an excellent opportunity for attendees to get hands-on experience with our tool, see its capabilities in action, and discuss potential applications for their own research or policy analysis work.

# Conclusion

We are excited to share our latest research and innovations with the tax policy community at the NTA Annual Conference. These presentations and our poster session reflect PolicyEngine's commitment to advancing the field of tax-benefit microsimulation and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to inform policy decisions. We look forward to engaging discussions and feedback from our peers in the field.

# Kamala Harris’s Child Tax Credit Proposal
Slug: harris-ctc
Date: 2024-08-17 01:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk

Description: We analyze the Democratic nominee’s proposal to expand the 2021 expansion, giving $6,000 to parents of newborns.

---

The Kamala Harris campaign yesterday released an [economic policy agenda](https://mailchi.mp/press.kamalaharris.com/vice-president-harris-lays-out-agenda-to-lower-costs-for-american-families) spanning housing, healthcare, grocery costs, and taxes. Her tax plan led with a pledge to “restore the American Rescue Plan’s expanded Child Tax Credit” and provide “up to $6,000 in total tax relief for middle-income and low-income families for the first year of their child’s life.”

Using the PolicyEngine model, we estimate that this Child Tax Credit expansion would have these effects in 2025:

- Cost $117 billion

- Benefit 44% of the population

- Cut child poverty 31%

- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 1.4%

While these effects assume no behavioral responses, the projected cost rises about five percent when applying elasticities from the Congressional Budget Office.

[_See how Kamala Harris’ Child Tax Credit proposal would affect you._](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) _(Make sure to select **2025**.)_

## The Child Tax Credit

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) currently provides up to $2,000 per child, with a partially refundable structure; that is, filers without tax liability can claim only part of the credit — currently, $1,700. Low-income parents who don’t benefit from the full non-refundable credit can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, which phases in with earnings above $2,500. The credit begins to phase out at incomes of $200,000 for single parents (head of household filers) and $400,000 for joint filers.

In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) temporarily expanded the CTC, increasing the maximum credit to $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for older children, making it fully refundable, and introducing an additional phase-out for higher-income households. We’ve previously analyzed the impacts of the [current CTC](https://policyengine.org/us/research/the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), [restoring the ARPA expansion](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expanded-child-tax-credit), and the [Biden-Harris 2025 budget proposal](https://policyengine.org/us/research/biden-budget-2025), which also included restoring this expanded CTC.

## The Harris Plan

Kamala Harris has now proposed not only restoring the ARPA expansion but also adding a “baby bonus” of $2,400 for children in their first year of life, bringing the total credit to $6,000 for newborns. While she has not yet detailed the baby bonus mechanism, we assume it follows the [American Family Act of 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3899), which had 211 cosponsors in the House (all Democrats) and phased out the baby bonus with the ARPA expansion.

## Household Impacts

Consider a parent, or parents, with no earnings who bear a newborn. Under current law, they would receive no Child Tax Credit, since they have no tax liability for the non-refundable $2,000 credit to count against, nor do they have the earnings for the Additional Child Tax Credit (refundable component) to phase in with. Under Harris’s proposal, they would receive the full $6,000 baby bonus, adding $6,000 to their net income.

As this household’s earnings rise, the net benefit falls: while they receive $6,000 under Harris’ plan, the difference is less as they would be entitled to more of a credit under current law. While Harris hasn’t specified the “middle-income and low-income families” who would be eligible, we assume the additional credit phases out with the rest of the ARPA CTC, as House Democrats designed the 2023 American Family Act to do.

Broadening the picture, we can view how this household and others with one child would benefit, depending on their marital status and the child’s age.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3184/0*Hi7zttzYhstumibz)

The maximum benefit varies with the child’s age: $6,000 for newborns, $3,600 for children age one to five, and $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17. Since 17-year-olds are ineligible under current law, they see a larger benefit. Married parents benefit more in some earnings ranges for two reasons:

1. Their higher standard deduction reduces their tax liability under current law, which requires them to have higher earnings to benefit from the non-refundable CTC

1. The Harris CTC expansion phases out at a higher income level for married filers compared to single (head of household) filers

## Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s US microsimulation model version 1.54.3 and Enhanced Current Population Survey data, we estimate that Harris’ Child Tax Credit expansion would cost [$117.4 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) in 2025, assuming no behavioral responses. We project that the baby bonus contributes [$6.4 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63710&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) to its cost.

The reform would [benefit 44% of Americans](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us), including 26% who would gain at least 5% of their net income. Those in the eighth income decile are most likely to benefit, while those in the fourth decile are most likely to gain at least 5%.

**Harris Child Tax Credit Impact by Income Decile**
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*MOotvlk1g6GWT9sF)

Assuming full take-up, the proposal would reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure 9.1% overall, with disproportionate impact for children (30.5%), Black and Hispanic Americans (10.6% and 11.4%), and women (9.7%). It would also reduce deep poverty 9.9%, including 36.3% among children. Finally, Harris’ CTC would reduce [income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) by between 0.6% (top 1% share) and 1.4% (Gini index), depending on the measure.

## Labor Supply Effects

Incorporating labor supply responses based on Congressional Budget Office elasticities modifies these projections:

- Hours worked would fall by [0.25%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=63523&focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.hours&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=46590)

- Earnings would fall by [0.14%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.earnings.overall.relative&reform=63719&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us)

- The total federal cost would increase 4.8% to [$122.9 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=63523&focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=46590) (state and local income tax revenue would also fall $0.9 billion)

- The child poverty impact would fall 6% (1.7pp) to [28.8%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=63719&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us)

About one-third of these changes reflect the “income effect” (people working less because they have more money), while two-thirds reflect “substitution effects” (changes in work incentives due to altered marginal tax rates).

## Conclusion

Based on the PolicyEngine model analysis, the proposed Child Tax Credit expansion by Kamala Harris is projected to cost $117.4 billion while reducing child poverty 31% without assuming behavioral responses, which would raise the cost 5% and lower the child poverty impact 6%. These projections are based on current economic conditions and assume full implementation and take-up of the proposed policy. Actual outcomes may vary based on economic fluctuations, implementation details, and other policy interactions.

We invite you to use our tools to explore the reform in more detail at the [US-wide level](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us), to view how it affects your own state (for example, [here’s California](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=ca)), and to see how it would affect [your own household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025).

Description: The reform signed by Governor Tim Walz expanded credits for low-income families, reduced taxes for middle-income retirees, and raised taxes for high-income filers.

---

In March 2023, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed into law [HF1938](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF1938&version=4&session=ls93&session_year=2023&session_number=0&format=pdf), a tax reform bill that modifies several aspects of the state’s tax code. The legislation introduces changes to family tax credits, retirement benefit subtractions, and deductions for high-income taxpayers.

PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation results for 2023 project that HF1938’s individual income tax provisions:

- Cost $444 million

- Reduced poverty by 2% and child poverty by 9%

- Increased net income for 22% and reduced net income for 4% of Minnesotans

- Lowered the Gini index of income inequality by 0.9%

This report describes provisions of HF1938, illustrates the impacts with hypothetical households, and summarizes projected Minnesota-wide impacts.

[_See the Minnesota impacts_](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46737)

[_See how HF1938 would affect your own household_](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=intro&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889)

# Provisions of HF1938

HF1938 expanded low-income tax credits, adjusted retirement income subtractions, and reduced standard and itemized deductions for high-income filers. It also included several provisions PolicyEngine does not currently model, including property tax adjustments as well as education tax credit.

## Working Families Tax Credit

The new law introduces a combined Child and Working Family Tax Credit, replacing the previous Working Family Credit (which resembled the federal Earned Income Tax Credit) and adding a new child tax credit (CTC) component:

## Introduces Retirement Benefits Subtraction for Public Sector Pensions

- Subtracts up to $12,500 ($25,000 married) in public sector pension benefits from state adjusted gross income

- Phases out at 5% of income above $78,000 ($100,000 married)

## Expands Social Security Subtraction

- Increased the maximum amount of Social Security benefits subtracted from state adjusted gross income from $4,020 to $4,560 ($5,150 to $5,840 married)

- Increased reduction thresholds from $61,080 to $69,250 ($78,180 to $88,630 married)

- Maintains $40,000 phase-out window (10% per $4,000 income above the threshold)

## Expands Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)

- Made married filing separately filers eligible for the state CDCC

## Further Reduces Standard and Itemized Deductions for High Income Filers

- Adds two new reductions to standard and itemized deductions for high-income filers, atop the existing reduction equal to 3% of income above $110,325 ($220,650 married): 10% of income over $304,970 and 80% of income over $1,000,000

# Household Impacts

## Child and Working Family Credit

The new Child and Working Family Tax Credit provides up to $3,385 to eligible Minnesota households. For instance, a single parent with two children (ages 10 and 5) earning $30,000 now receives an additional [$1,656](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46721) in refundable credits under the new structure.

The following graph shows how the reform affects a married couple with two children as well as for a single parent:[^1]

[^1]: I created this figure with [this code](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/analysis-notebooks/blob/main/us/states/mn/hf1938/mn_hf1938_wftc.ipynb). Other figures are from the PolicyEngine web app.

**Figure 1: Credit amount comparison of the Working Family Credit and the new Child and Working Family Credit on a couple and single parent of two (10 and 5) (2023)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2660/0*NTzfwwf6k2PVGxpq)

Looking at the [net impact](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46680), this household could receive up to an additional $3,500 due to the removal of the general earnings requirements for the Child Tax Credit component. The impact gradually reduces as the previous Working Family Credit phases in and spikes once more due to the delayed reduction start.

**Figure 2: Net income impact of the Minnesota Bill HF1938 on a single parent of two (10 and 5) with earnings up to $100k (2023)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*GJSskNDoNTqey6n8)

The credit change also impacts [marginal tax rates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46680) for the given family. The marginal tax rates increase by as much as 12 percentage points for earnings between $50,000 and $62,000.

**Figure 3: Marginal Tax Rate changes under the Minnesota Bill HF1938 on a single parent of two (10 and 5) (2023)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*eSBqpQM51uN6veYk)

## Reduced Standard Deduction

Zooming out, we can see that the reform reduces [this household’s](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46745) standard deduction for earnings between $310,000 and $775,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*2DLAosGOytyh8SuP)

Accordingly, the reform increases this household’s taxes by as much as $966, for earnings of $445,000.

## Social Security and public pension subtractions

To illustrate the changes to the subtractions for Social Security benefits public pensions, consider an individual receiving $25,000 in public pensions (for example, from teaching in public schools) and $20,000 in Social Security benefits. These are both roughly average values. This individual would pay up to $1,500 less in [income tax](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46737) due to the newly introduced public retirement income subtraction and the adjusted social security income subtraction.

# Microsimulation Results

PolicyEngine’s US microsimulation model (version 1.57.1), run over the indexed 2022 Current Population Survey March Supplement for 2023, reveals several key impacts of HF1938’s individual income tax provisions:

- Costs [$444 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889)

- Lowers Minnesota’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by 1.9%, including [9.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889) for children and [45.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889) for deep child poverty

- Reduces income inequality in Minnesota: the Gini index falls [0.8%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46737), while the net income share held by the top 1% and 10% each fall 0.2%

[22%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889) of residents will experience an increase in their after-tax income due to these changes, including 35% of those in the bottom income decile. Conversely, 4% of residents will see a reduction in their after-tax income, including 38% of those in the top income decile.

These results assume no behavioral responses.

# Conclusion

The Minnesota tax reform bill HF1938 introduces changes to the state’s tax structure, particularly in areas of family tax credits, retirement benefits, and deductions for high-income earners.

The microsimulation results suggest that these reforms will reduce inequality and poverty, especially among children. The changes in tax credits and deductions create a mixed effect across income levels, with a majority of residents seeing increased after-tax income, while a smaller percentage, primarily in higher income brackets, experience reductions.

Description: We show the impact on different households of the tax credit bill introduced by then-Senator Kamala Harris.

---

Kamala Harris on Friday released her [economic plan](https://mailchi.mp/press.kamalaharris.com/vice-president-harris-lays-out-agenda-to-lower-costs-for-american-families), including an expanded Child Tax Credit we [analyzed](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-ctc) on Saturday. Absent from the housing portion of her plan was legislation she introduced in 2018 and 2019 as a Senator: the Rent Relief Act (RRA), a refundable tax credit based on income, rent paid, and local housing costs. In this post, we use the PolicyEngine model to explore its effects on different household types, and how it situates with other tax and benefit programs. We focus on a typical example, as well as two ends of the credit’s generosity spectrum, based on local housing costs, at which the bill caps countable rent.

# Legislative History

While Harris introduced the RRA in the Senate in 2018 and then 2019, the bill dates back to 2017 and continues to be active:

- 2017: Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) [introduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3670/) the initial version with eight cosponsors.

- 2018: Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) [reintroduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6671) it in the House; Sen. Kamala Harris introduced a [Senate companion bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3250).

- 2019: Sen. Harris and Rep. Danny Davis (D-IL) reintroduced it in the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1106) and [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2169), respectively, reducing the maximum rent from 150% to 100% of fair market rent.

- 2022: Rep. Davis and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) [reintroduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4728?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22rent+relief+act%5C%22%22%7D&s=4&r=3) the bill.

- 2023: Rep. Davis [reintroduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6721) it without a Senate companion.

The bill has not changed since 2019, and all 25 cosponsors in the latest House bill are Democrats.

# Mechanics of the Proposed Credit

The RRA establishes a refundable tax credit based on household income, rent paid, and local housing costs. The bill defines local housing costs from Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), which HUD [sets](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmrs/FY2024_code/2024summary_sa.odn) at the 40th percentile of rents in each ZIP code, broken down by the number of bedrooms. HUD publishes these SAFMRs annually, and [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tH3NQXmLisDgxjl0WUbnQvS05OskAKI27Lk1gIOsfA4/edit?usp=sharing) shows them for 2024.

Key features of the credit:

- Covers a percentage of rent exceeding 30% of the household’s gross income

- Percentage decreases as income increases, according to the following schedule: 100% for incomes up to $25,000, 75% for incomes over $25,000 but not over $50,000, 50% for incomes over $50,000 but not over $75,000, 25% for incomes over $75,000 but not over $100,000, 0% for incomes over $100,000

- Thresholds are $25,000 higher in [areas](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/safmr) that use SAFMRs instead of FMRs (which HUD defines at the metro level) for the Housing Choice Voucher program

- Uses SAFMRs to determine maximum allowable rent for credit calculation

- Alternate rules for residents of public housing (not modeled in this piece)

- Credit is refundable, meaning it can exceed the amount of taxes owed

This structure creates a varying impact on households depending on their income, rent, and location. The subsequent sections will explore these impacts through specific examples.

# Examples

We will examine three examples to illustrate the Rent Relief Act’s effects on different household types across various income levels. These examples will focus on a typical household, as well as two households at opposite ends of the credit’s generosity spectrum based on local housing costs.

## A Typical Example: Sherman-Denison, Texas

Consider a [single parent](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=46796&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) with two children living in ZIP code 75459 in Sherman-Denison, Texas, an area with SAFMRs close to the median that does not use SAFMRs for the HCV program. Suppose this household pays $1,500 per month in rent for their three-bedroom home, less than the $1,590 per month SAFMR. Suppose further that they earn $40,000 per year. The credit would cover 75% of the difference between their rent ($18,000) exceeding 30% of their income ($12,000), or 75% of $6,000 which is $4,500.

We can see this visually by displaying the credit with earnings, showing the steps at $25,000 and $50,000, and their ineligibility at $60,000 income (30% of which is $1,500 per month).

**Figure 1: Rent Relief Act for a Sherman-Denison, Texas 3-bedroom**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3036/0*_bG50g06m6fg3p2c)

The steps at $25,000 and $50,000 income create cliffs. Combined with other tax and benefit programs, the household would have a lower net income if earning between $25,000 and $48,000.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*EPuCVy97aGQvFyUk)

## The Low End: Missouri studios

HUD has designated the country’s lowest SAFMR as studios in a set of ZIPs in central Missouri, at $540 per month. Consider an [individual](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=46651&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) living in a studio apartment in this area paying $600 per month:

- If their income is $0, they would receive the full $540 per month ($6,480 annually) as a credit.

- As their income increases, the credit phases out at a 30% rate.

- At $21,600 annual income (30% of which is $540 per month), they would no longer be eligible for the credit.

**Figure 3: Rent Relief Act for a Missouri Studio**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3128/0*aWj1gSnt06wvXQAS)

As their baseline marginal tax rate ranges from 0% to 62% in this range, the RRA [increases it](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=46651&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) to between 30% and 92%.

**Figure 4: Rent Relief Act Marginal Tax Rate Impact on a Single Person in a Missouri Studio**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3044/0*TVnDJ119xe338vNK)

## The High End: San Diego four-bedroom homes

The country’s highest SAFMR is 4bd in several areas in San Diego: $6,960. This is also an area where SAFMR is used for HCV, raising RRA income thresholds by $25,000.

Consider a [married couple](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=46575&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) with three children paying at least $6,960 per month in rent in a 4bd home in one of these areas. If they have no income, they will receive the full $6,960 per month, or $83,520 per year. That will phase out at a 30% rate, until they earn $50,000, at which point the credit covers 75%, rather than 100%, of the gap between rent and 30% of their income. It then steps down again at $75,000, $100,000, and finally $125,000 income at which point they become ineligible.

**Figure 5: Rent Relief Act for a San Diego 4-bedroom**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3100/0*IUCRsmREyRmi5cj-)

While the credit phases out at a 30% rate for any segment, it creates a higher average marginal tax rate over the full earnings range due to the steps: by reducing the credit from $83,520 to $0 over the earnings range $0 to $125,000, it adds 67 percentage points to their marginal tax rate.

Stacking the credit atop other tax and benefit programs for this household reveals its effect on cliffs. Accounting for state and federal income taxes, and benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the household faces a baseline average marginal tax rate of 38% from $0 to $125,000: they receive $22,817 at zero earnings and $100,351 at $125,000. The RRA thus increases their MTR to 105% over this range; their net income is $106,337 at zero earnings and $100,351 at $125,000.

**Figure 6: Rent Relief Act Impact on a Couple with Three Children in a San Diego 4-bedroom**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3136/0*laJ8B-XezYYRjNIA)

It’s worth noting that the bill does not set a maximum number of bedrooms based on household size, unlike the [Housing Choice Voucher](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/HCV_Guidebook_Calculating_Rent_and_HAP_Payments.pdf#page=7) program. This means the San Diego example could theoretically apply to a single individual living in a four-bedroom home.

## Comparison Across Household Types

To illustrate how the Rent Relief Act affects different household types across various income levels, we can compare the credit amount for all three example households as a function of income:

**Figure 7: Rent Relief Act Credit for Selected Homes**

![](/images/posts/rent_relief/rent_relief_comparison.png "image_tooltip")

This chart demonstrates several key features of the Rent Relief Act:

- Initial Credit Amount: The San Diego household starts with the highest credit due to the high local SAFMR, followed by the Sherman-Denison household, and then the Missouri household.
- Phase-Out Rates: All households experience the same 30% phase-out rate between income thresholds, as evidenced by the parallel slopes in these regions.
  Income Thresholds: The San Diego household’s income thresholds are $25,000 higher than the other two due to the use of SAFMRs for the Housing Choice Voucher program in that area.
- Credit Duration: The San Diego household remains eligible for the credit at much higher income levels compared to the other two households, due to both the higher initial credit amount and the elevated income thresholds.
- Cliff Effects: All three households experience cliff effects at their respective income thresholds, where the credit amount drops sharply over a small increase in income.
- Zero Credit Point: The income level at which each household becomes ineligible for the credit varies significantly, from $21,600 for the Missouri household to $60,000 for the Sherman-Denison household, and $125,000 for the San Diego household.

This comparison illustrates how the Rent Relief Act’s impact varies based on local housing costs and whether an area uses SAFMRs for the Housing Choice Voucher program. It also highlights the uniform nature of the phase-out structure across different household types and locations, while showing how this structure interacts with varying rent levels to produce different outcomes for each household.

# Conclusion

The Rent Relief Act (RRA) of 2019 proposes a refundable tax credit that would have varying impacts on renter households across the United States. This analysis demonstrates several key aspects of the bill’s potential effects:

- Geographic Variation: The credit’s value differs based on location due to its reliance on Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs). As shown in the examples, the maximum credit ranges from $540 per month in low-cost areas of Missouri to $6,960 per month in high-cost areas of San Diego.

- Income-Based Phase-Out: The credit’s structure, with its stepped percentage reductions at specific income thresholds, creates a set of incentives that vary with household income. This design leads to cliff effects at $25,000 income increments, where increases in earnings can result in decreases in credit amount.

- Interaction with Existing Programs: When combined with other tax and benefit programs, the RRA can alter marginal tax rates. In some cases, as demonstrated in the San Diego example, this can lead to situations where households may face high marginal tax rates or see their net income decrease as their earnings increase.

- Rent-to-Income Ratio: The credit’s design targets households paying more than 30% of their income in rent, with the largest benefits going to those with the highest rent burdens relative to their incomes.

- Potential Locational Incentives: By tying the credit amount to local rent levels, the RRA could potentially influence household decisions about where to live.

- Flexibility in Unit Size: Unlike some housing assistance programs, the RRA does not limit unit size based on household composition.

These features of the Rent Relief Act illustrate the various factors involved in designing housing assistance policies that aim to address affordability issues across diverse housing markets and household types. The bill’s impacts would likely vary depending on local housing costs, household incomes, and interactions with existing social programs.

In modeling the program’s effects, it is important to consider these incentive effects. Given our recent work integrating labor supply responses in microsimulations, we plan to examine the literature around migration to incorporate this into future analysis. This approach will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how the RRA might influence both employment decisions and geographical mobility.

Further research could explore the potential effects of the RRA on rental markets, including possible impacts on rent levels and housing supply. Additionally, analysis of the bill’s budgetary implications and its effects on poverty rates and housing stability across different demographic groups could provide insights for understanding the full scope of the proposed legislation.

# How the Oregon Rebate May Affect Poverty Rates
Slug: oregon-rebate
Date: 2024-09-29 01:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, 2024-election, policy, us-or
Description: Our model finds the ballot measure could reduce poverty by between 22% and 35%, without macroeconomic effects.

---

_Disclaimer: The Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity has provided financial support to both PolicyEngine and the Oregon Rebate campaign._

This November, Oregon voters will vote on [Measure 118](<https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_118,_Corporate_Tax_Revenue_Rebate_for_Residents_Initiative_(2024)>), the Corporate Tax Revenue Rebate for Residents Initiative. According to Ballotpedia, the ballot measure, broadly known as the _Oregon Rebate_, would operate by "increasing the corporate minimum tax on sales exceeding $25 million by 3%, removing the minimum tax cap, and distributing increased revenue to Oregon residents who spend more than 200 days in the state."

If it passes, the measure would provide its first payments in early 2026, structured as either a refundable tax credit for the 2025 tax year, or as a payment for nonfilers. Oregon's Legislative Revenue Office projected that these first payments would amount to $1,160 for each person (regardless of age), followed by $1,605 in 2027 and $1,686 in 2028\.

Using the PolicyEngine microsimulation model, we have projected the impact of this bill on poverty in each year, under four scenarios spanning the federal taxability of the payments and the incidence of the tax. Overall we find that the policy would reduce poverty by between 20% and 36% overall depending on the scenario and year, with larger effects for children and in later years. We do not model behavioral or macroeconomic effects of the policy, either resulting from the payments or from the tax.

# Analysis

Should the Oregon Rebate pass, the first payments, estimated at $1,160, will arrive in early 2026\. Since tax filers will receive them as a refundable credit, the Census Bureau would count them toward 2025 net resources when determining the Supplemental Poverty Measure. If the payments had no other effects on income or the economy, and if the federal government did not tax them, PolicyEngine estimates that it would reduce Oregon's poverty rate 24%, from 10.0% to 7.6%. Child poverty would fall 33%, from 8.5% to 5.7%, while adult poverty would fall 22.4%.

Three other factors could affect these results:

1. The payments could affect households' taxes or benefits.
2. Households could bear some or all of the tax that funds the payments.
3. The taxes and/or payments could affect the broader economy.

We modeled the first two of these factors.

## Federal taxability

Regarding taxes or benefits, the Oregon Rebate's similarity to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend suggests parallels. In 1982, Alaska established a universal annual payment that has [ranged](https://pfd.alaska.gov/Division-Info/summary-of-dividend-applications-payments) from $331 to $3,284 per person. In neither case is state income tax an issue: Alaska has none, and the Oregon ballot measure exempts it. And in neither case are benefit programs directly affected: both states reserve a "hold harmless fund" for households whose benefits (e.g., the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](https://alaskalawhelp.org/resource/snapfood-stamps)) fall as a result of the payment counting as income for means tests.

However, the IRS has required Alaskans to enter the permanent fund dividends on their federal tax returns. In recent years, Alaska has bundled a non-taxable "one-time energy relief payment" with the taxable dividend payments; for example, the 2024 payment combines a $1,312 dividend with $390 in energy relief. Depending on the IRS's view of the Oregon Rebate structure, the payments may or may not be federally taxable.

Most households near the poverty line face low tax rates. As a result, PolicyEngine does not project that the taxability will affect the poverty impact in 2025, though it reduces the poverty impact by 5% in 2026 and 2027\.

## Tax burden

The Oregon Rebate is funded by a gross receipts tax on corporations with over $25 million in Oregon sales. Such a tax could affect Oregonians through various mechanisms including higher prices, lower wages, lower employment, and lower investment income.

While PolicyEngine does not currently model the burden of corporate taxes like these, we approximated it as a flat tax on adjusted gross income, calibrated to match the expenditure on the rebate. To fund the rebates, we projected Oregon would need to levy flat taxes of 1.98% in 2025, 2.53% in 2026, and 2.55% in 2027\.

Adding such a flat tax to the simulation reduces the Oregon Rebate's poverty impact by about 10% across years.

## Macroeconomic effects

Using its [Oregon Tax Incidence Model](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/lro/Documents/rr2-01otim_finalreport.pdf), a computable general equilibrium model of the Oregon economy, the Oregon Legislative Revenue Office [estimated](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/lro/Documents/IP%2017%20Report.pdf) that the Oregon Rebate would contract the economy and increase prices by 2030\. Compared to current law, they projected personal income to fall 0.71%, population to fall 0.05%, employment to fall 0.99%, wages to fall 0.05%, and prices to rise 1.3%.

PolicyEngine does not currently consider macroeconomic effects such as these in its modeling.

## Results

[The following dashboard](https://oregon-rebate.streamlit.app) summarizes the Oregon Rebate's poverty impact by age group and year, across a two-by-two of scenarios around federal taxability and whether the tax burden is allocated to households as a flat income tax. The results are "static" and do not account for potential macroeconomic effects.

# Methodology

We produced this analysis with the PolicyEngine US microsimulation model v1.103.0. PolicyEngine's state-level microsimulation model applies the most recent three years of the Current Population Survey March Supplement—2021 to 2023—the same data used by the Census Bureau to estimate the Supplemental Poverty Measure by state. Across the three years, this data included 2,619 households in Oregon.

PolicyEngine then "ages" various characteristics of the microdata based on projections from government agencies like the Congressional Budget Office. For example, we age wages and salaries according to projected earnings growth, and poverty thresholds by projected inflation.

Finally, we estimate taxes and benefits based on the PolicyEngine model of federal and state tax and benefit rules. This model includes federal and state income taxes, including future-dated changes such as the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2026, as well as benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Supplemental Security Income. Here we apply state-specific rules and index policy parameters based on projected index changes (generally inflation). We also model the take-up rate of benefits like SNAP and SSI.

While the Census Bureau relies on the CPS for poverty reporting, and various organizations use it for poverty analysis, the CPS has limitations that affect this analysis. For example, high incomes are "top-coded" (truncated), benefits and some income sources are under-reported, and the distribution of income diverges from administrative sources. PolicyEngine [addresses these shortcomings](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) in national analyses by integrating tax records and calibrating to hundreds of statistics, but has not yet done so for state-level estimates. Correcting the data may change the baseline poverty rates and other distributional measures that may affect the projected impact of the Oregon Rebate on poverty.

_The Oregon Rebate campaign previously cited earlier estimates from the PolicyEngine web app. We have since updated our model, incorporating new Census data released in September 2024, adding two more years of data, imputing rent and property tax data from the American Community Survey for the SNAP excess shelter deduction, and assigning SNAP take-up rates._

# Exempting Social Security Benefits from Income Taxation
Slug: social-security-tax-exemption
Date: 2024-10-07 01:00:00
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, 2024-election, policy, featured
Description: PolicyEngine projects that former President Donald Trump’s proposal would cost $1.4 trillion over the budget window.

---

On July 31st, [former President Donald Trump announced](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/social-security-benefits-tax-trump/index.html) his intention to exempt Social Security benefits from income taxation if he were elected president. Currently, the US taxes a percentage of Social Security benefits above certain thresholds. Exempting these benefits from taxation would reduce the tax liability of some American households while decreasing federal revenues. Using PolicyEngine, we have analyzed former President Trump’s proposal and estimated its effects on specific family compositions as well as its greater impact on the federal budget and income distribution.

Key results (static):

- Costs $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2034

- Benefits 17% of Americans in 2025

- Affects poverty, inequality and labor supply anywhere between 0.02% and 2.3% in 2025, depending on the specific measure.

[_Try our personalized calculator:_](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) See how exempting Social Security benefits would affect your household.

## How Social Security Benefits are Taxed Today

Calculating the taxation of Social Security benefits for a household involves a [few steps](https://www-origin.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/taxes.html). First, Social Security recipients must determine their “combined income”. Combined income is defined as the sum of an individual’s adjusted gross income (AGI), nontaxable interest and half of their Social Security benefits. If a recipient’s combined income exceeds certain thresholds, the US taxes a portion of their benefits and directs the revenues to Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance (OASI and DI) and Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. Specifically:

1. If combined income is under $25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers), Social Security benefits are not taxed.

1. If combined income exceeds these thresholds, 50% of an individual’s Social Security benefits are taxable, with the revenue directed towards the OASI and DI Trust Funds.

1. If combined income exceeds $34,000 ($44,000 for joint filers), an additional 35% of benefits are subjected to taxation with the revenue allocated to the Medicare HI Trust Fund.

In 2023, these taxes comprised [4.3%](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2024/tr2024.pdf) and [8.4%](https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2024) of the Social Security and Medicare HI Trust Funds, respectively, with payroll taxes comprising 90.3% and 88.4%.

Rather than have all Social Security payments be fully taxable, this structure only makes a portion of the benefits subject to federal income taxes. [The graph below](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=67048&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=46100) compares the current structure of Social Security benefit taxation (baseline) to a scenario where Social Security benefits are fully taxable (reform) for a single adult with $24,000 in annual payments.

As displayed in the graph above, the current structure results in lower-income beneficiaries not being subject to any income tax on their Social Security benefits, with at least 15% of an individual’s benefits remaining non-taxable. In the example above, a single retired adult who receives $2,000 a month from Social Security ([around the average benefit](https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-01903#:~:text=Views:,most%20convenient%20way%20to%20apply.)) does not face any income taxation as their combined income of $12,000 falls below the $25,000 threshold. This person pays [$705](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=67048&household=46100) less in taxes compared to if Social Security benefits were fully taxable. A married couple where one spouse also receives $2,000 a month from Social Security but the other continues to work earning $70,000 [saves $432](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=67048&household=47870) due to the current structure. If they earned $150,000, the household would have a [$792](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=67048&household=47942) reduction in their income taxes.

## Household Impacts

Let’s examine the effect of exempting Social Security benefits from taxation on the previous households. Because the single retired adult does not face any taxation under the current structure, making all benefits non-taxable would [leave their net income unchanged](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=46100). However, the family with $70,000 in earnings would [reduce their tax liability by $2,448](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47869), while the household earning $150,000 in addition to their Social Security benefits would [gain $4,488](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47942). [The graph below](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47942) shows how net income changes for the two married households as their earnings increase assuming Social Security benefits become non-taxable.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ugkw_zWAcbafI0gZ)

Table 1 shows how the net income of the three households would change if Social Security benefits were made taxable or non-taxable.

**Table 1: Net Income Impact for Households Under Different Social Security Taxation Schemes**

| Household Type (All Have $24,000 in Social Security Benefits) | If Social Security Benefits Were Fully Taxable | If Social Security Benefits Were Non-Taxable |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Single, No Earnings                                           | -$705                                          | $0                                           |
| Married, $70,000 in Earnings                                  | -$432                                          | $2,448                                       |
| Married, $150,000 in Earnings                                 | -$792                                          | $4,488                                       |

## Microsimulation Results

To estimate the effect across the country, we set both the [50% and 85% taxable rates to 0%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.social_security.taxability.rate.base&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47734) in the PolicyEngine web app, thereby eliminating any income taxation on Social Security benefits. The nationwide impact of this proposal using our microsimulation model is as follows:

## Budgetary Impact

We at PolicyEngine project making Social Security benefits non-taxable to [cost the federal government $98.9 billion in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47942), assuming no behavioral responses. Additionally, the reform will cost state and local governments $2.9 billion, due to how some states tie their AGI to the federal AGI. When [considering behavioral responses](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=67174&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47942) (applying elasticities used by the Congressional Budget Office), the federal cost of the proposal in 2025 falls slightly to $97.8 billion due to a positive substitution effect (workers responding to a lower marginal tax rate), partially offset by a negative income effect; overall work hours and earnings are projected to rise by 0.02% and 0.04%, respectively.

Over the next ten years (tax years 2025 to 2034), exempting Social Security benefits from income taxation would cost the federal government a total of $1.4 trillion using static modeling. The Medicare HI Trust Fund would see its revenue decrease by $587.7 billion, while the Social Security Trust Funds would lose the remaining $834.9 billion.[^trust-fund-split] Eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would [increase Social Security’s shortfall and put Medicare HI into a deficit](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html), thus accelerating each of their trust funds’ insolvency dates; for instance, the $40.8 billion impact on the Medicaid HI Trust Fund in 2025 exceeds the $25 billion projected surplus for 2024.

[^trust-fund-split]: To calculate the revenue loss of each trust fund, we first set the additional taxable rate for Social Security benefits [from 85% to 50%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=67180&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2). This change simulates the revenue lost for the Medicare HI Trust Fund. We then subtracted this amount from the total federal revenue loss to calculate the impact on the Social Security Trust Funds. See the [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2024/tr2024.pdf) and [Medicare HI](https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2024) Trust Fund reports for benchmarks.

**Table 2: Annual Federal Budgetary Impact for Exempting Social Security Benefits from Income Tax**

Our federal cost estimate falls between projections from the [Tax Foundation ](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/)(lower) and the [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/donald-trumps-suggestion-end-taxation-social-security-benefits) (higher) over a ten-year period. The CRFB used data from the Congressional Budget Office and Social Security Trustees.

**Table 3: Comparison of Federal Budgetary Impact Estimates**

| Organization             | Estimate (in billions $) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| PolicyEngine (Static)    | -1,422.6                 |
| Tax Foundation (Static)  | -1,196.9                 |
| Tax Foundation (Dynamic) | -1,180.6                 |
| CRFB (CBO)               | -1,600.0                 |
| CRFB (Trustees)          | -1,800.0                 |

## Income Distribution 2025

Under the proposal, 17% of Americans would see their net incomes increase, disproportionately in the top half of the income distribution.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2PqZGSYLcwAkYXWn)

The average benefit for all households is $670 for 2025. However, the ninth and tenth income deciles would receive an average benefit of $1,653 and $1,908, respectively, while the bottom two deciles would see their net incomes rise by less than $100.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*cUWrmb9Nfu3HZmml)

Exempting Social Security benefits from income taxes would reduce the overall Supplemental Poverty Measure by [0.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47734) and lower senior poverty by 2.3%. Finally, the effect on income inequality would be mixed, as the proposal would [increase the Gini index by 0.1%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=67049&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47734), raise the top decile’s net income share by 1.3% but reduce the top percentile’s share of net income by 0.2%.

## Conclusion

Exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would increase the net income of American households while reducing revenues by $1.4 trillion over the next ten years, accelerating the insolvency dates of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. While the reform’s dollar impact rises with income, only 1.6% of the tax benefits would accrue to the bottom two deciles while 45.5% of the benefits would flow to the top 20% of households. The proposal would impact poverty, inequality and labor supply, overall affecting any of the relevant measures by 2.3% or less.

# Kamala Harris’s Earned Income Tax Credit Expansion Proposal
Slug: harris-eitc
Date: 2024-10-24 01:00:00
Authors: Nikhil Woodruff
Tags: us, 2024-election, policy, featured
Description: PolicyEngine projects that restoring the American Rescue Plan policy would cost $144 billion (static) or $201 billion (dynamic) over a decade, while lowering poverty by 1.6% in 2025.

---

Vice President Harris proposes expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for filers without qualifying dependents. This analysis examines the proposal’s key aspects, potential impacts, and provides economic projections from PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model.

[**See the full impact in PolicyEngine**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=67696&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732)

## The proposal

In her [economic plan](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf#page=13), Harris proposes to restore the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without children to its level under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

This would:

- Increase the phase-in and phase-out rates from 7.65% to 15.3%

- Lower the minimum age from 25 to 19 (or 24 for students)

- Remove the maximum age, currently 65

- Raise the maximum credit from $632 to $1,774 (adjusted from $1,502 in 2021 for inflation, and continuing to rise with inflation in future years)

These characterize the EITC policy as shown below.

| Year | Phase-in rate | Max credit | Phase-out start | Phase-out rate |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 2025 | 15.3%         | $1,774     | $13,706         | 15.3%          |
| 2026 | 15.3%         | $1,815     | $14,022         | 15.3%          |
| 2027 | 15.3%         | $1,852     | $14,306         | 15.3%          |
| 2028 | 15.3%         | $1,888     | $14,582         | 15.3%          |
| 2029 | 15.3%         | $1,924     | $14,858         | 15.3%          |
| 2030 | 15.3%         | $1,962     | $15,150         | 15.3%          |
| 2031 | 15.3%         | $2,001     | $15,450         | 15.3%          |
| 2032 | 15.3%         | $2,041     | $15,758         | 15.3%          |
| 2033 | 15.3%         | $2,082     | $16,074         | 15.3%          |
| 2034 | 15.3%         | $2,124     | $16,398         | 15.3%          |

Single filers with earnings between $8,000 and $37,000 would see their net incomes increase due to this policy change.

For more examples of the policy’s household impacts, see our [2023 article](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc) on the ARPA EITC expansion. That article’s estimates preceded our [Enhanced Current Population Survey](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) launch.

## Nationwide impacts

Based on [static microsimulation modeling](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=67696&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) with PolicyEngine US (version 1.103.0), we project the following economic impacts for 2025.

### Cost

Here we estimate the ten-year costs, both with and without behavioral responses, and compare against other scorekeepers.

#### Static

Assuming no behavioral responses, we project that the EITC expansion will cost the federal government $14.3 billion in 2025. Due to state and local EITC matches, it will also cost state and local governments $1.6 billion.

Over the [ten-year budget window](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uf-gmlWPDCasV6KP68M2165wGLqjDf8m#scrollTo=fKBzuOkw9i8n), this amounts to $143.7 billion.

| Year    | Federal cost (billions $) |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 2025    | 14.3                      |
| 2026    | 14.4                      |
| 2027    | 14.7                      |
| 2028    | 14.6                      |
| 2029    | 14.5                      |
| 2030    | 14.4                      |
| 2031    | 14.3                      |
| 2032    | 14.2                      |
| 2033    | 14.2                      |
| 2034    | 14.1                      |
| 2025-34 | 143.7                     |

#### Dynamic

Incorporating elasticities of labor supply used by the Congressional Budget Office increases the reform's cost. [In 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.hours&reform=67706&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2):

- Hours worked falls by 0.27%, or 411,000 full-time equivalent jobs

- Total earnings fall by 0.09%, or $11.7 billion

- The federal budgetary cost rises 38% to $19.7 billion, including $2.1 billion in spending on benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Applying these elasticities over the full budget window increases our cost estimate by 40%, from $143.7 billion to $200.9 billion.

| Year    | Federal cost (billions $) |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 2025    | 19.7                      |
| 2026    | 20.2                      |
| 2027    | 20.2                      |
| 2028    | 20.4                      |
| 2029    | 20.4                      |
| 2030    | 20.1                      |
| 2031    | 19.8                      |
| 2032    | 20.2                      |
| 2033    | 20.0                      |
| 2034    | 19.9                      |
| 2025-34 | 200.9                     |

#### Comparison to other analysts

The Office of Management and Budget estimated the cost of restoring the ARPA EITC when President Biden released his 2025 budget, which included the provision. The Tax Foundation and Penn Wharton Budget Model have also estimated the proposal’s cost. PolicyEngine projects higher costs than these other organizations when considering behavioral responses, as they have.

PolicyEngine’s Enhanced CPS data is calibrated to be consistent with EITC payment statistics. For this policy score, we added statistical calibration over EITC returns and dollar amounts by tax filer child counts, which account for [non-take-up](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JRC20_Volume3.pdf#page=62).

Our higher cost may partly owe to our accounting of benefit programs like SNAP; for example, if a worker is in the EITC phase-out earnings range, the reform will increase their marginal tax rate. We would then simulate their earnings to fall, in accord with CBO assumptions. At a lower earnings level, the person may be eligible for additional SNAP benefits. Our rules engine accounts for that additional cost, while some other organizations only account for federal costs via taxes.

## Distributional impacts

The PolicyEngine microsimulation model supports distributional analysis by decile, as well as poverty and inequality. Unlike cost, other organizations have not provided distributional impacts for us to compare against.

### By decile

The average household [sees](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=67064&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=47732) an increase in net income of $109, between federal, state, and local EITCs, while households in the bottom two deciles gain the most on a relative basis.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3152/0*r6VvrLKiMIAkn9jx)

12% of the population benefits, and 5% gain more than 5% of their prior net income. Under one percent of households lose income due to their state EITC match being more generous for demographically-ineligible EITC households than the expanded EITC is.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*s42zWiiXqimZLITE)

### Poverty

We [estimate](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=67696&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) that the expanded EITC would reduce the poverty rate by 1.3% (0.4 percentage points), or about 1 million people. Child poverty falls less than 0.1% because some children live in households with workers who file separately to them.

### Inequality

The Gini index of income inequality also [falls](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=67696&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) by 0.2%, and the top-10 and top-1 percent shares of income fall by around 0.1%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3196/0*AeI48oVouiLsbEg-)

## Key findings

The PolicyEngine static microsimulation model projects the following:

1. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to its level from 2021 would cost $144 billion over the 2025–2034 budget window on a static basis, or $201 billion with labor supply responses (per CBO).

2. The proposal disproportionately benefits lower-income households, both in terms of relative impacts on net income and population share gaining.

3. Overall poverty falls 0.4 percentage points, with the largest impact on people aged 18 to 64.

4. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, falls 0.2% .

# Extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

Description: PolicyEngine projects extending the TCJA individual tax provisions would cost $3.9 trillion over a ten-year budget window.

---

[In December 2017](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-signs-tax-cut-bill-first-big-legislative-win-n832141), former President Donald Trump signed into law the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text) (TCJA). The bill modified several components of the tax code, reducing the tax liability for most households while increasing federal deficits. Most individual provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025. At PolicyEngine, we have simulated extending the TCJA's individual tax provisions against current law to analyze its effects on both households and the broader economy.

Key results:

- Costs $4.2 trillion from 2026 to 2035, assuming no behavioral responses, or $3.9 trillion applying CBO elasticities.

- Increases net income for 80.2% and reduces net income for 1.8% of Americans in 2026.

- Reduces poverty by 4.1% and child poverty by 7.0%.

- Increase hours worked and earnings by 0.71% and 0.78%, respectively when applying CBO elasticities.

## What did the TCJA change?

The TCJA implemented key changes to the individual tax code that will expire at the end of 2025. The major reforms include:

- Lowering five of seven tax rates, including the top rate from 39.6% to 37%

- Adjusting tax bracket thresholds three through six

- Doubling the standard deduction, child tax credit (CTC), and estate tax exemption[^1]

- Eliminating personal and dependent exemptions

- Expanding the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption and phase-out threshold, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to AMT

- Modifying itemized deductions, including a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction

- Introducing a qualified business income deduction (QBID) for pass-through entity owners

- Permanently indexing inflation-indexed parameters to the Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U) instead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).

[^1]: The standard deduction and estate tax exemption are no longer doubled, due to the change in inflation indexing since 2017.

Beyond these individual provisions, the TCJA permanently reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and made other temporary adjustments to other business and corporate taxes. We've restricted our analysis to household provisions, enumerated in Table 1 below.

_Starred parameters indexed to inflation._

[Our simulations](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48812) include every listed provision except the mortgage interest deduction and estate tax exemption.[^2]

[^2]: PolicyEngine's US model is currently unable to evaluate the impact of the mortgage interest deduction or estate tax. Based on external analysis, the revenue gained from limiting the mortgage interest deduction partially offsets the revenue lost from doubling the estate tax exemption, suggesting our budgetary projections remain fairly accurate. Nevertheless, including these provisions in a TCJA extension would affect the distributional analysis for households subject to either or both policies.

## Household Impacts

Extending the TCJA will affect households differently depending on their size, income, and other characteristics. To illustrate these effects, let's examine the impacts for a few example households—with income only from wages and no itemized deductions—for 2026.

**Table 2: Change in Net Income Based on Household Composition**

| Marital status | Children | Earnings   | Change in Net Income                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single         | 0        | $15,000    | [$140](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48802)    |
| Single         | 1        | $30,000    | [$1,020](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=47295)  |
| Married        | 1        | $70,000    | [$1,170](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48807)  |
| Married        | 2        | $150,000   | [$5,055](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48809)  |
| Married        | 3        | $1,000,000 | [$33,053](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48812) |

While taxes do not always decrease monotonically with income (see Appendix A), each household with a higher income net benefits more than another family with a lower income in these examples. This can be mainly attributed to the TCJA's lower income tax rates. Families with children see additional benefits from the expanded CTC, provided their income falls below the phase-out threshold. High-earning families experience the largest gains, as demonstrated in the final example, where their change in net income substantially exceeds other households shown in the table. Figure 1 displays the change in net income based on household income for the family composition in the fourth example.

## Federal Budgetary Impact

Extending the TCJA would reduce federal revenues by [$4.2 trillion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48812) over ten years using static modeling. [When considering behavioral effects](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=69005&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) (applying CBO elasticities), earnings rise 0.78%, in turn lowering the cost by 7.7% to $3.9 trillion; these effects primarily occur through the substitution effect (people working more as their marginal tax rate falls), partly offset by the income effect (people working less as they have a higher net income). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) [currently projects](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59710) federal deficits to total $20 trillion from 2025-2034; extending the TCJA's individual provisions, without any offsets, would thus raise deficits by roughly 20% over a decade.

[^4]: Currently, the PolicyEngine US model can only simulate to 2034. In order to provide a full ten-year budget window estimate, the budgetary impacts for 2035 are calculated by taking the percent growth from 2033 to 2034 and applying this growth to the 2034 budgetary impact.

The CBO, using estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, projects costs 0.2% lower than our projection. Table 4 compares to other notable scorekeepers.

[^5]: Some of the organizations in the comparison included some miscellaneous provisions such as extending the pass-through loss deduction limitation and expanding opportunity zones in their estimates. As we did not include these provisions and others in our own estimates, we removed them, when possible, from each organization's projection to obtain a closer comparison.

[^6]: The CBO, Tax Foundation, and Yale Budget Lab only project the cost of extending the TCJA through 2034. In order to compare its estimate with ours, we utilized the same process to obtain our 2035 projection by taking the percent growth from each organization's 2033 to 2034 scores and multiplying this growth to each estimate in 2034.

## Income Distribution 2026

Extending the TCJA would [benefit 80% of the U.S. population](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48809) while reducing the net income for 2% of Americans. More households in the top half of the income distribution would benefit than in the bottom half.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*wUuFzDjWkuLS3FRf)

In 2026, the [average household benefit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) when extending the TCJA is $2,338. However, the top two income deciles would receive a larger benefit as their net income would rise by $5,063 and $9,194, respectively. Conversely, on average, the bottom two deciles would see their taxes reduced by $311 or less.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*vb67YpfvKS_YoCf7)

Extending the TCJA would also [reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48809) by 4.1% and the Supplemental Child Poverty Measure by 7.0%.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ThsBUfxd5XSPzEqa)

## Conclusion

Extending the individual provisions of the TCJA would reduce federal revenues by $4.2 trillion (static) or $3.9 trillion (dynamic) over the next decade, absent offsetting measures. The reform would increase the net income of 80% of Americans while lowering it for 2%. The majority of benefits (54%) would flow to the top income quintile, while the bottom quintile would receive just 2%.

As policymakers evaluate options for addressing these expiring provisions, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

We invite you to explore our [additional analyses](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/research) and use [PolicyEngine](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us) to calculate your own tax benefits or design custom policy reforms.

## Appendix A: Explanation for non-monotonic impacts for a joint filer with two children

For most filers and income ranges, the benefit of TCJA rises with income. However, for a married couple with two children (as an example), the benefit of extending the TCJA declines in at least two earnings ranges for 2026:

1. $34,600 to $37,800

2. $54,500 to $62,000

Both ranges occur for similar reasons, namely the interaction between standard deductions, personal exemptions, and the CTC.

### $34,600 to $37,800

To illustrate this nonmonotonicity, we calculate the effect at both ends of the range.

[At $34,600:](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49119)

Under a TCJA extension, the household has $4,000 in taxable income ($34,600 of earnings - $30,600 of their standard deduction). This translates to a $400 tax liability as their taxable income falls into the 10% tax bracket. The household's tax liability is fully offset by CTC as they receive their household maximum of $4,000. $400 is used to offset their tax liability while the remaining $3,600 is refunded to the household.

Under current law, the household has no taxable income (household earnings of $34,600 is below the combined standard deduction and exemptions of $37,800). The household would receive a refund of $2,000 from the CTC.

Therefore the net benefit of extending the TCJA for this household would be $1,600 ($3,600-$2,000).

[At $37,800:](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49120)

Under a TCJA extension, the household would have $7,200 in taxable income ($37,800 of earnings - $30,600 of their standard deduction). This results in a $720 tax liability as their taxable income is solely in the 10% tax bracket. The tax liability is fully offset by CTC as they receive the maximum of $4,000. $720 is used to offset their tax liability while the remaining $3,280 is refunded to the household.

Under current law, the household also has no taxable income (household earnings of $37,800 are completely offset by the combined standard deduction and exemptions of $37,800). The household would receive a refund of $2,000 from the CTC.

Therefore the net benefit of extending the TCJA for this household would be $1,280 ($3,280-$2,000).

The declining benefit ($1,600 -> $1,280) occurs because the TCJA's standard deduction ($30,600) is lower than the combination of standard deduction and exemptions ($37,800) under current law. This results in a household developing taxable income sooner, thus creating a higher tax liability and reducing the TCJA's advantage over this range.

### $54,850 to $62,050

At this income range, we see another decline in TCJA benefits due to the interaction between tax brackets and the CTC.

[At $54,850:](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49121)

Under a TCJA extension, the household has $24,250 in taxable income ($54,850 of earnings - $30,600 standard deduction). This results in a $2,425 tax liability as their taxable income falls entirely in the 10% tax bracket. The household's tax liability is fully offset by CTC as they receive their household maximum of $4,000. $2,425 is used to offset their tax liability while the remaining $1,575 is refunded to the household.

Under current law, the household has $17,050 in taxable income ($54,850 of earnings - $37,800 combined standard deduction and exemptions). This results in a $1,705 tax liability as their taxable income is solely in the 10% tax bracket. $1,705 of their $2,000 CTC is used to offset the tax liability, with the remaining $295 refunded to the household.

Therefore the net benefit of extending the TCJA for this household would be $1,280 ($1,575-$295).

[At $62,050:](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69001&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49127)

Under a TCJA extension, the household has $31,450 in taxable income ($62,050 of earnings - $30,600 standard deduction). This results in a $3,289 tax liability, with the first $24,250 taxed at 10% ($2,425) and the next $7,200 taxed at 12% ($864). The household's tax liability is fully offset by CTC as they receive their household maximum of $4,000. $3,289 is used to offset their tax liability while the remaining $711 is refunded to the household.

Under current law, the household has $24,250 in taxable income ($62,050 of earnings - $37,800 combined standard deduction and exemptions). This results in a $2,425 tax liability as their taxable income is solely in the 10% tax bracket. $2,000 of CTC partially offsets the household's tax liability, leaving $425 in taxes owed.

Therefore the net benefit of extending the TCJA for this household would be $1,136 ($711 - (-$425)).

The declining benefit ($1,280 -> $1,136) occurs because once the household earns more than $54,850, they are pushed into the 12% tax bracket under a TCJA extension. Under current law, they would remain in the 10% bracket until their earnings reach $62,050. This higher marginal rate reduces the TCJA's advantage versus current law.

In addition to these two ranges, the net benefit of a TCJA extension falls during other points as household income rises. These can also be attributed to the interactions of the standard deduction, exemptions, CTC, and adjustments to income tax bracket thresholds.

# Donald Trump's Economic Agenda
Slug: trump-2024

Description: PolicyEngine projects three provisions of Donald Trump’s tax plan would cost $5.4 trillion over the next ten years.

---

Throughout the election cycle, we at PolicyEngine have covered a few of former President Trump’s policy proposals. This includes: [exempting Social Security benefits](https://policyengine.org/us/research/social-security-tax-exemption#user-content-fn-trust-fund-split) from income tax and [extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://policyengine.org/us/research/tcja-extension) (TCJA) individual provisions. Additionally, Donald Trump has signaled that he would repeal the [SALT deduction cap](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/donald-trump-salt-tax/index.html), reversing the $10,000 limit he signed into law with the passage of the TCJA. We at PolicyEngine have combined these three policies into one reform to simulate the effects of at least part of Donald Trump’s economic agenda and analyze its impact on households and the U.S. economy.

Key results:

- Costs $5.8 trillion from 2025 to 2034, assuming no behavioral responses, or $5.4 trillion when applying the Congressional Budget Office’s labor supply responses.

- Increases net income for 81.6% of Americans and lowers poverty by 4.6% in 2026, assuming no behavioral responses.

- Increase hours worked and earnings by 0.82% and 0.79% in 2026, respectively when applying CBO elasticities.

## Donald Trump’s Tax Plan

Donald Trump has released several more policy proposals during the cycle. These reforms include:

- Excluding [tipped income](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J0fUTiJLVc&t=1920s) and [overtime pay](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-overtime-pay-taxes/index.html) from taxation

- Deducting [interest on car loans](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/trump-wants-to-make-auto-loan-interest-tax-deductible-heres-who-benefits.html) from taxable income (presumably as an itemized deduction)

- Imposing [across-the-board tariffs](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-favors-huge-new-tariffs-how-do-they-work), with higher rates on imports from China

- Extending TCJA's corporate tax provisions

While this analysis does not include these proposals, we at PolicyEngine have released a [2024 election household calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/2024-election-calculator) containing the reforms examined in this analysis and the listed provisions above. Read our previous reports on how [exempting Social Security benefits](https://policyengine.org/us/research/social-security-tax-exemption) and [extending the TCJA's individual provisions](https://policyengine.org/us/research/tcja-extension) would independently affect American households and the U.S. economy.

## Household Impacts 2026

Implementing all three policies would have varying effects on American households. To understand their impact, we have analyzed several family compositions with various earnings, social security benefits, and state and local expenses.

**Table 1: Change in Net Income Based on Household Composition**

| Marital Status | Children | Earnings   | Social Security Benefits | State and Local Tax | Change in Net Income                                                                                                                                               |

| Single         | 1        | $30,000    | $0                       | $0                  | [$1,020](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49231)  |
| Married        | 0        | $70,000    | $24,000                  | $0                  | [$3,911](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49225)  |
| Married        | 2        | $150,000   | $0                       | $0                  | [$5,055](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49234)  |
| Married        | 3        | $1,000,000 | $0                       | $100,000            | [$39,158](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49239) |

For a single retired adult receiving just above the [average Social Security retirement benefit](https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-01903#:~:text=Views:,most%20convenient%20way%20to%20apply.) (first example), their net income would see no change as their benefits face zero taxation under the current structure. While net income does not always rise with increased earnings, it does for most households which can be viewed in Table 1. This trend can be mainly attributed to the reduction in income tax rates from extending the TCJA. Additionally, families with children see an increase in net income due to the changes in the child tax credit (assuming their earnings are below the phase-out threshold). Households with high earnings, like in example five, see the largest gains. If they have real estate taxes that can be deducted using the SALT deduction, they benefit even more. Figure 1 shows how net income changes as household income rises for a married couple with two children (example four).

## Federal Budgetary Impact

Donald Trump’s three policies would reduce federal revenues by $5.8 trillion over ten years when utilizing [static modeling](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2). [When considering behavioral effects](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=69666&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) (applying [CBO’s central elasticities](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/43674-laborsupplyfiscalpolicy.pdf#page=4)), the cost drops to $5.4 trillion. In 2025, the [budgetary impact](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=49239) of the proposals is much smaller as the extension of the TCJA’s individual provisions does not come into effect until tax year 2026. Additionally, the number of total hours worked and earnings would decrease in 2025 before increasing as compared to the current baseline in subsequent years. As mentioned in our TCJA analysis, the [CBO projects](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59710) that federal deficits would total $20 trillion over the next decade. Implementing all three policies, without any offsets, would raise deficits by roughly 27% using our dynamic estimate.

**Table 2: Federal Budgetary Impact of Three of Donald Trump’s Tax Policies (in billions $)**

| Year    | Static   | CBO Labor Supply Responses |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| 2025    | -171.2   | -177.2                     |
| 2026    | -522.4   | -497.4                     |
| 2027    | -548.3   | -522.0                     |
| 2028    | -572.8   | -541.6                     |
| 2029    | -598.8   | -568.8                     |
| 2030    | -627.0   | -597.0                     |
| 2031    | -653.4   | -623.2                     |
| 2032    | -685.1   | -652.8                     |
| 2033    | -715.6   | -684.1                     |
| 2034    | -745.2   | -713.7                     |
| 2025-34 | -5,839.8 | -5,400.6                   |

## Income Distribution 2026

Enacting these reform policies would [increase the net income of 81.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49239) of Americans in 2026. 0.6% of Americans see lower net income, likely due to state tax interactions. A larger share of households in the upper half of the income distribution would benefit compared to those in the lower half. Our distributional estimates assume no behavioral responses.

In 2026, the average household benefit when enacting these reforms is [$3,570](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49239). However, the families in the top income decile would receive an average benefit of $16,608, while the lowest decile would receive just $345, assuming no behavioral responses.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*9BPsZ7C5woD91CYq)

Donald Trump’s three policies would also [reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 4.6%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=69665&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=49239) in 2026, assuming no behavioral effects. Additionally, senior and child poverty would drop by 7.0% and 8.2%, respectively.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*DMAUDgM1BG7e3wv9)

## Conclusion

Implementing three of Donald Trump’s tax proposals would reduce federal revenues by $5.8 trillion (static) or $5.4 trillion (dynamic) over the next decade unless paired with offsetting measures. These reforms would increase the net income of 81.6% of Americans while lowering it for 0.6% in 2026. 59% of benefits would flow to the top income quintile, while the bottom quintile would receive 2%. Additionally in 2026, Donald Trump’s tax provisions would lower poverty by 4.6% (static) and increase earnings by 0.79% (applying CBO elasticities).

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

Description: PolicyEngine has created a personalized calculator for the 2024 presidential election’s tax proposals.

---

Try our [**2024 election calculator**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/2024-election-calculator) to see how Harris and Trump’s proposed policies would affect your household’s finances. Enter your family details, income sources, and spending patterns to get personalized estimates.

Read on for a few examples of our new tool in action.

## A young family in Minnesota

Consider a married couple, both 35, with two young children ages 4 and 7. Here are their details:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*IU-QdfGEVxXkIft9)

Based on [U.S. Census Bureau trade statistics](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html), the average American consumed $1,275 in Chinese imports and $8,025 in other foreign goods in 2023. We’ve given this household half this nationwide average (which may fall in response to tariffs), or twice the per-capita values for a four-person household.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ZjAq6duUhQlODCwC)

Under Vice President Harris’s proposed policies, this family would see their net income increase by $2,600 to $57,777, driven by the expanded Child Tax Credit. Their federal refundable credits would increase from $5,039 to $9,639, as you can view in detail in the _Federal Credits_ tab of the right hand table.

Under President Trump’s proposed policies, their net income would decrease by $3,160 to $52,017, due to the impact of new tariffs on imported goods. While the plan includes provisions like making overtime and tip income tax-exempt, this family doesn’t have income in those categories to offset the tariff costs.

## A semi-retired couple in Florida

Our second example is a semi-retired couple, both 68, living in Florida. They receive $45,000 in Social Security benefits and earn additional income through part-time work ($20,000 in regular wages, $8,000 in tips, and $4,000 in overtime). They spend $1,000 annually on Chinese goods and $5,000 on other foreign products.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*rT-o7KW1E--raLml)

Under Trump’s proposed policies, this couple would see their net income increase by $578 to $74,370. The tax exemptions on their tip and overtime income, along with changes to Social Security taxation, outweigh the impact of new tariffs. Their income tax before credits would decrease from $3,208 to $1,530.

Under Harris’s policies, their net income would remain unchanged at $73,792, as her reforms target different demographic groups and income levels.

## A professional family in New York City

Our third example examines a married couple, both 45, with one child age 12, living in New York City. Their financial profile:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ASgEmeXyw16z7qPa)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Qzx5nqo0BcLOKrWH)

Harris’s policies would increase their net income by $1,000 to $116,790, through expanded child tax benefits. Trump’s policies would decrease their net income by $1,132 to $114,658, with tariff costs outweighing the benefits from the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap removal.

## A high-net-worth individual in California

Our final example is a single 55-year-old living in California with investment income. Their income includes:

- Wages: $100,000

- Capital gains: $800,000

- Qualified dividends: $20,000

- Non-qualified dividends: $5,000

- Rental income: $24,000

- Import spending: $2,000 Chinese goods, $10,000 other foreign goods

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*zl0R7x035uQi75HN)

Under Trump’s policies, their net income would increase by $28,114 to $571,473. This change comes from the removal of the SALT deduction cap, which reduces tax liability in high-tax states like California.

Under Harris’s policies, their net income would decrease by $7,479 to $571,473, due to changes to capital gains taxation for high-income households.

## Key takeaways

These examples show how each candidate’s proposals affect households differently based on:

- Family composition and age

- Sources and levels of income (wages, investments, tips, overtime, Social Security)

- State of residence and local tax burden

- Spending patterns on imported goods (the U.S. imported [$427 billion in goods from China](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html) and [$3.1 trillion in total goods](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/AnnualPressHighlights.pdf) in 2023)

- Eligibility for tax credits

The examples demonstrate impacts ranging from changes of a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars.

## Calculate your household’s results

# Federal Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025
Slug: federal-tax-inflation-adjustments-2025
Date: 2024-11-19 09:30:00
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, featured
Description: PolicyEngine has updated all relevant federal tax parameters based on the latest IRS announcements.

---

[On October 22nd](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2025), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its annual inflation adjustments for tax year 2025. Over sixty provisions of the federal tax code are indexed for inflation, including income tax thresholds, the standard deduction, and the earned income tax credit (EITC), which impacts the millions of American households who file their taxes each year. At PolicyEngine we have updated our US model to reflect these changes based on the [latest IRS report](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-24-40.pdf).

## How does the IRS update tax parameters?

Federal tax law requires inflation adjustments for certain tax parameters using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) defines CPI as “a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.” As prices grow over time, CPI increases accordingly. The Bureau maintains multiple versions of CPI including the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers (CPI-U), the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners (CPI-W), and the Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI). Before 2018, legislation required the use of CPI-U for indexed tax provisions; however, the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://policyengine.org/us/research/tcja-extension) mandated a switch to Chained CPI, which accounts for consumer substitution behavior and by construction results in smaller inflation adjustments.

## What was updated?

PolicyEngine has modeled most federal income tax provisions since 2022. Additionally, we use [inflation projections](https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#10) from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and statutory rounding rules to estimate the values of these provisions for future years. This allows accurate calculations of future tax benefits and proper analysis of policy proposals for tax year 2025 and beyond.

The IRS updates generally increased the inflation adjustment by about 10% beyond our CBO-based projections. For example, CBO projected that the standard deduction for single people would rise $350 from $14,600 in 2024 to $14,950 in 2025, while the IRS updated the value to $15,000. That $400 increase exceeded the $350 projection by 14%. Table 1 displays these [standard deduction](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.deductions.standard.amount.HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD) values for all filing statuses.

**Table 1: IRS Updates for the Standard Deduction in Tax Year 2025**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TbTgAmxeWLYzM0UExeQ73Q.png)

In addition to updating the standard deduction values, we also modified the values for the following provisions.

- [Aged/blind standard deduction amount](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.deductions.standard.aged_or_blind.amount.HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD)

- [Dependent standard deduction amount](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.deductions.standard.dependent.amount)

- [EITC maximum values](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.credits.eitc.max%5B0%5D.amount)

- [EITC joint bonus](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.credits.eitc.phase_out.joint_bonus%5B0%5D.amount) (difference between phase-out for single and joint filers)

- [EITC maximum investment income amount](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.credits.eitc.phase_out.max_investment_income)

- [EITC phase-out start](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.credits.eitc.phase_out.start%5B0%5D.amount)

- [Estate tax exemption](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.credits.estate.base)

- [Qualified business income deduction phase-out start](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.deductions.qbi.phase_out.start.HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD)

- [Alternative minimum tax (AMT) threshold](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.income.amt.brackets%5B1%5D.threshold)

- [AMT exemption amount](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.income.amt.exemption.amount.HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD)

- [AMT child exemption amount](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.income.amt.exemption.child.amount)

- [AMT phase-out start](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.income.amt.exemption.phase_out.start.HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD)

- [AMT separate limit](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.irs.income.amt.exemption.separate_limit)

# Introducing GiveCalc
Slug: givecalc
Date: 2024-12-03 09:30:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, featured, giving
Description: Calculate the true cost of charitable giving.

---

This Giving Tuesday, we’re launching [**GiveCalc**](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/givecalc), a free tool that calculates how charitable giving affects your US taxes and net income[^eagx] When you make a tax-deductible donation, you reduce your tax liability — but quantifying that reduction requires modeling complex interactions across federal and state tax systems.

[^eagx]: The concept originated at a hackathon at EAGxBerkeley in December 2022. Rather than rush to release, we prioritized accuracy and comprehensiveness, developing and validating our model of income taxes at the federal level and across all 50 states, DC, and NYC. We are grateful to the collaborators from that session, who regrettably remain unnamed as we lost track of them.

## What GiveCalc does

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*OdmKfI9wWmTydOwB)

GiveCalc starts by collecting your household information. Take a California family earning $200,000, with two children and $15,000 in mortgage interest and property taxes. Without donations, they take home $153,895 after paying $46,105 in federal and state taxes.

The tool then computes three key metrics about charitable giving:

A $20,000 donation reduces their taxes by $3,136, costing them $16,864 in net income. The tax savings come from itemizing deductions on both their federal and California returns — without the mortgage interest and property tax deductions, they would save less since they’d take the standard deduction.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*spyC-yuaxbTT6SKA)

This net cost calculation reflects interactions between:

- Federal and state itemized deductions

- State-specific charitable credits and deductions

- Marginal tax rates that vary with income

- Phase-outs and other provisions that depend on adjusted gross income

## The marginal giving discount

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8GUprxTadvMn1xt0)

GiveCalc introduces the “marginal giving discount” — the tax reduction from your next dollar of giving. Our example family saves 31 cents in taxes on their next donated dollar, reflecting their federal and California marginal tax rates.

This rate changes as donations affect tax bracket thresholds and deduction eligibility. GiveCalc visualizes these nonlinearities to help donors optimize their giving.

## Finding your target donation

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*kreBCnVz6vAPbnJq)

Beyond computing the tax impact of a specific donation, GiveCalc can work backward: enter your desired reduction in net income, and it calculates the donation required to achieve that target.

For example, if our family wants to reduce their net income by 10% (from $153,895 to $138,506), they need to donate $17,854.

## Technical Implementation

GiveCalc extends PolicyEngine’s US tax-benefit model with several key features:

1. **Integrated federal and state modeling:** Computes taxes at federal, state, and local (NYC) levels, showing how each affects the giving cost.

1. **Interactive visualization:** Using Plotly, GiveCalc creates dynamic charts showing how taxes change with donation amounts.

1. **Streamlit interface:** The web app runs on Streamlit’s Community Cloud platform, providing a responsive interface without requiring user accounts.

1. **Optimization algorithm:** To find target donation amounts, GiveCalc computes outcomes across many scenarios using PolicyEngine’s validated microsimulation model.

## Next steps

We’ve [open sourced GiveCalc on GitHub](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/givecalc) and welcome contributions. Key areas for expansion include:

- Adding more income sources (most of which we already model, and only need to expose in the interface)

- Expanding to other countries (PolicyEngine operates in the US and UK)

- Supporting additional tax scenarios

- Enhancing visualization options

# Louisiana Transitions to a Flat Tax
Slug: louisiana-flat-tax
Date: 2024-12-10 09:30:00
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, featured, louisiana
Description: Analysis of the individual tax changes signed into law by Governor Jeff Landry.

---

Last week, Governor Jeff Landry (R-LA) signed [HLS 243ES-13](https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1390576), which reforms several parts of the individual income tax code:

1. Converting the current three income bracket structure of 1.85%, 3.5%, and 4.25% into a flat tax at a rate of 3%.

2. Introducing a standard deduction of $12,500 for single and separate filers and $25,000 for all other filing statuses.

3. Repealing personal exemptions: $4,500 per filer, $1,000 per dependent, and $1,000 additional for aged and blind filers.

4. Increasing the exemptions for retirement and disability income from $6,000 to $12,000.

We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect these changes and analyzed their effects on the state of Louisiana and its residents.[^bill]

[^bill]: HLS 243ES-13 also converted the graduated corporate tax rate to a flat 5.5% rate, increased the state sales tax from 4.45% to 5%, and eliminated the corporate franchise tax. PolicyEngine does not currently model these policies.

Key results for 2025:

- Costs $1.3 billion

- Reduces taxes for 82% of Louisiana residents and raises taxes for 0%

- Reduces the state’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by 0.8%

- Increases the Gini index of income inequality by 0.3%

_Use PolicyEngine to [view the full results](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49786) or [calculate the effect on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=input.household.taxYear&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680)._

## Household Impacts 2025

To see how families in Louisiana would be affected by the discussed tax changes, let’s examine a few relevant household compositions.

**Table 1: Change in Net Income Based on Household Composition**

| Household Composition                          | Change in Net Income                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single, No Children, No Earnings               | [$0](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49781)     |
| Single, One Child, LA Minimum Wage             | [$137](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49783)   |
| Married, Two Children, Median Household Income | [$423](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49786)   |
| Married, Three Children, $500,000 Income       | [$5,616](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49788) |

The changes in the tax code benefit all the households above, except for a single adult with no earnings as they had no previous tax liability. A single parent with one child earning $15,080 (Louisiana’s full-time [minimum wage](https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wages) equivalent) would see their tax bill drop by $137. A married couple with two kids with earnings at the state’s [median household income](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/LA/POP060210) would gain $423 from the individual income tax changes. However, a family making $500,000 would see the largest increase in their net income by far, paying $5,616 less in taxes in 2025. Below is a graph displaying the change in net income for the third example based on household income.

**Figure 1: Change in Net Income for a Married Couple with Two Children Based on Household Income**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bhTvRZmrkutW2pUL)

## Statewide Impact 2025

Using PolicyEngine static modeling, the individual income tax provisions enacted in Louisiana’s special legislative session will cost the state [$1.3 billion for tax year 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49786), aligning with [Gov. Landry’s cost projection](https://apnews.com/article/tax-bill-louisiana-landry-ec1a84124c751f32b9dcee6174dc9af2). [82% of Louisiana residents](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49786) would see an increase in their net income: 99% of those in the upper half of the income distribution and 65% of those in the bottom half. While the bottom tax rate rises from 1.85% to 3%, the higher standard deduction prevents filers from having a higher income tax liability.

**Figure 2: Winners and Losers of Louisiana Individual Income Tax Changes**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*FUDVEC4_M1YfLgDT)

The reform cuts taxes by an average of [$709 per household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=la&timePeriod=2025&baseline=71680&household=49786), with the average amount rising at each income decile.

**Figure 4: Average Benefit of Louisiana Individual Income Tax Changes by Decile**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*X4r5pcECxr0fRuwl)

The tax changes would reduce Louisiana’s poverty rate by 0.8% and deep child poverty rate by 1.5%, applying the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Furthermore, the reforms would increase the state’s Gini index of income inequality by 0.3%.

## Conclusion

The individual income tax changes signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry will reduce state revenues by $1.3 billion in 2025. 82% of Louisiana residents will see an increase in their net income from the analyzed provisions, disproportionately those in higher-income households. The top quintile will receive 57% of the tax savings while the bottom quintile will receive 1.4%.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

# New AI Feature Helps People Understand Their Taxes and Benefits
Slug: us-household-ai
Date: 2024-12-26 09:00:00
Authors: Anthony Volk
Tags: us, featured, ai
Description: We’re applying large language models to clarify complex policy rules.

---

PolicyEngine has developed a new artificial intelligence feature that transforms complex tax and benefit calculations into clear, accessible explanations. This innovation emerged from our participation in the Georgetown Beeck Center’s [Policy2Code Challenge](https://digitalgovernmenthub.org/get-involved/policy2code/) with a central question: How can we help users better understand their tax and benefit eligibility?

<center>[Interactive: fnuDyLKpt90]</center>

Users frequently encounter intricate calculations spanning multiple programs, each with distinct thresholds, phase-outs, and dependencies. Our solution combines PolicyEngine’s open-source rules engine with artificial intelligence to explain these calculations in plain language, building on our [previous work applying AI to policy analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research/gpt-analysis).

# Technical architecture

The system integrates PolicyEngine’s tax-benefit rules with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet API. When calculating program amounts like the Child Tax Credit or Supplemental Security Income, PolicyEngine processes thousands of intermediate calculations involving household income, deductions, and other eligibility factors. Our new explanation system passes these complex intermediate calculations to the AI system, which generates natural language explanations.

For example, consider [a family of four in Connecticut](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=50156) with a three-year-old child and $47,000 income. PolicyEngine calculates that they qualify for $475 in annual benefits from WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Users can now click a tooltip followed by an “**Explain with AI ✨**” button to receive a comprehensive explanation of their eligibility and potential changes that could affect their benefit amount.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*x0qcBrqb0Zapj8Ob)

The AI system analyzes both final outcomes and the intermediate calculations contributing to them. Many variables in PolicyEngine’s system involve dozens of intermediate steps, calculated at both monthly and annual levels. This new feature makes these calculation chains transparent and comprehensible.

# Applications and impact

This explanation tool serves diverse needs across the policy ecosystem.

Description: We've expanded our modeling framework to capture how policy changes affect labor supply.

_We’re grateful to [Arnold Ventures](https://www.arnoldventures.org/) for supporting this model enhancement and research._

When faced with new public policies, Americans adjust their economic behaviors. These policy changes — whether at the federal or state level — set off chain reactions across society. Workers [modify their working hours](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.3.471), investors change [when to realize their gains](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.50.1.3), and businesses [reshape their practices](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117913). Looking at policies through a static lens misses these dynamic human responses to changing incentives. PolicyEngine incorporates two fundamental behavioral responses to policy changes, which we explain in this report:

1. Income effects on labor supply

1. Substitution effects on labor supply

How do we measure behavioral responses to policy changes? The key lies in _elasticities_, which measure how people respond to policy changes. A larger elasticity signals a stronger behavioral shift, while a smaller one indicates more modest adjustments. PolicyEngine lets users quickly apply elasticities from the Congressional Budget Office or set their own. This report describes these responses and how they affect results in our microsimulation model.

# How income and substitution effects affect labor supply

In PolicyEngine, we model how Americans adjust their work hours through two key mechanisms: income and substitution effects. Income effects show how people might choose more leisure time when their income increases. Substitution effects capture how workers respond when their take-home pay for extra hours changes.

# Income elasticity

How do people adjust their work hours when they become better off? The income elasticity measures this behavior, quantifying how Americans modify their work patterns when their take-home pay changes through taxes and transfers. Following the [Congressional Budget Office (CBO)](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/43674-laborsupplyfiscalpolicy.pdf#page=4)’s central estimate, PolicyEngine sets the default income elasticity at **-0.05**. In practical terms, a 10% increase in after-tax income results in an average of 0.5% decrease in work.

# Substitution elasticity

How much people work often depends on their take-home pay per extra hour. The substitution elasticity measures this relationship — how work habits change when the reward for additional hours shifts. For instance, when higher tax rates or steeper benefit phase-outs reduce the pay from extra hours, workers might cut back on overtime or reduce part-time hours. PolicyEngine implements the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/43674-laborsupplyfiscalpolicy.pdf#page=4)’s heterogeneous substitution elasticities, which vary by income level. The elasticities range from 0.31 for the lowest income decile to 0.22 for the highest deciles among primary earners, with secondary earners at 0.32. This means when workers in the lowest income decile keep 10% less of their earnings from each additional hour, they typically reduce their work by 3.1%, while higher-income workers reduce their work by 2.2%. The full range of elasticities by income group is shown in the table below.

# A practical example

To see how these elasticities work in practice, let’s examine how a Massachusetts worker earning $50,000 annually would respond to a potential increase in the state income tax rate from 5% to 6%:

Our Massachusetts worker earns $25.00 per hour, working 2,000 hours annually for $50,000 total earnings. Their net income changes from $40,034 to $39,598 due to an increase in state income tax from 5% to 6%. This $436 reduction represents a 1.09% drop in their current net income ($436 / $40,034 = 0.0109 = 1.09%). The percentage differs from the 1pp tax rate increase because the tax applies to gross income while the percentage change is relative to net income, which is lower due to taxes and deductions.

Under the policy change, their net marginal hourly wage would fall from $18.83 to $18.58; this $0.25 drop is 1% of their $25 nominal wage and represents a 1.3% fall in their net marginal wage. It’s important to note that the change in net income (-1.09%) is smaller than the 1% increase in the state tax rate due to several factors:

- The standard deduction reduces taxable income before the tax rate is applied

- The tax increase only affects state taxes, not federal taxes or other deductions

- The percentage change is calculated against total take-home pay, which includes all adjustments and deductions

To understand these calculations in detail, let's examine how this worker responds to the policy change. Applying the CBO's elasticities, this reform triggers two behavioral responses:

## Substitution effect

| Component                 | Value     | Calculation                           |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Initial net marginal wage | $18.83/hr | $25 \* (1-MTR_baseline)               |
| New net marginal wage     | $18.58/hr | $25 \* (1-MTR_reform)                 |
| Relative change           | -1.3%     | ($18.58 - $18.83) / $18.83            |
| Substitution elasticity   | 0.25      | Based on income percentile (40th)[^1] |
| Hours worked change       | -0.325%   | -1.3% × 0.25                          |
| Annual hours change       | -6.5 hrs  | -0.325% × 2,000 hrs                   |
| Earnings impact           | -$162.50  | -6.5 hrs × $25/hr                     |

## Income effect

| Component           | Value     | Calculation                   |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Initial net income  | $40,034   |                               |
| New net income      | $39,598   |                               |
| Relative change     | -1.09%    | ($39,598 - $40,034) / $40,034 |
| Income elasticity   | -0.05     | Standard CBO value            |
| Hours worked change | +0.054%   | -1.09% × -0.05                |
| Annual hours change | +1.08 hrs | +0.054% × 2,000 hrs           |
| Earnings impact     | +$27.00   | +1.08 hrs × $25/hr            |

Combining these opposing effects yields a net reduction of 0.271% in work hours. For our Massachusetts worker, this translates to approximately 5.4 fewer work hours (0.271% of 2,000) and $135.5 less in earnings per year (5.4 hours × $25/hour).

| Component               | Value     | Source                |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| Total hours change      | -5.42 hrs | -6.5 hrs + 1.08 hrs   |
| Percent change in hours | -0.271%   | -5.42 hrs / 2,000 hrs |
| Total earnings impact   | -$135.50  | (-$162.50) + $27.00   |

[^1]: The substitution elasticity varies across the income distribution. $50,000 in earnings places the worker at the [40th earnings percentile](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/blob/31d7b3359dc3de2aa1523408be0f2b87d360e4a5/policyengine_us/variables/gov/simulation/labor_supply_response/labor_supply_response.py#L114), (barely) mapping to the fifth decile. Based on CBO's labor supply elasticity table, this corresponds to an elasticity of 0.25 for primary earners, meaning people in these deciles work 2.5% less when they keep 10% less from each additional hour after taxes and transfers.

While this example shows how behavioral responses affect an individual worker, we can use PolicyEngine’s microsimulation to examine how these responses impact government revenues and distributional effects.

# Applying behavioral responses in PolicyEngine

By default, PolicyEngine operates with no behavioral responses. To activate behavioral responses, users can either:

1. Apply CBO’s behavioral responses with one click

1. Set their own elasticities using the same structure as the CBO’s (single income elasticity and substitution elasticities varying by income and primary/secondary)

The fastest way to apply behavioral responses is to toggle “Apply CBO behavioral responses” in the baseline policy section, as shown below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*4Nzt1Zq_2_A9zHiR)

This sets each of the elasticities per CBO’s table. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Parameters tab and find the elasticity settings under _Simulation > Labor supply responses_ as shown below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*El8byrS7rBWfNism)

When users input any non-zero elasticities, the model incorporates behavioral responses into its tax-benefit calculations. For each policy reform simulation, the model first calculates how policy changes affect both income and tax rates. Then, it estimates two behavioral changes:

- How changes in total income influence work decisions

- How marginal tax changes affect work hours

Since each person’s earnings can impact household net income differently, the model calculates marginal tax rates for each of the top three earners and applies their labor supply responses separately.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*s7N9nkrEjq1kO6OV)

After adjusting how much each worker earns, we apply the microsimulation model again to calculate their new taxes and benefits. For example, if elasticities imply that a reform will increase an earner’s labor supply (and they face a positive marginal tax rate), they will also pay more in tax after the final step.

# Macro effects of behavioral responses

To demonstrate how behavioral responses affect the broader fiscal impact, let’s examine the revenue implications of raising the Massachusetts state income tax rate from 5% to 6%. [Applying CBO’s elasticities](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.hours&reform=72611&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), we find that the reform would reduce hours worked by 0.24%. While the income effect raises employment by 1,700 full-time equivalents (since the tax lowers the net income of affected workers), the substitution effect lowers employment by 9,900 full-time equivalents (since affected workers see their net-of-tax wage rate fall), for a net effect of 8,200 FTEs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*bJLkz2SVHiZfy04i)

In turn, [earnings fall 0.27%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.laborSupplyImpact.earnings.overall.relative&reform=72611&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2); this exceeds the hours worked effect because low-income workers, who pay no state tax under current law due to various deductions, exemptions, and non-refundable credits, are unaffected by the reform. Extended visualizations show how these effects vary with income decile.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*-MxdT_8m74KZCM5C)

Finally, the reduced earnings in turn reduce the revenue projection from [$3.6 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=72337&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) without behavioral responses to [$3.2 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=72338&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) with them (an 11% reduction). PolicyEngine estimates the effect of behavioral responses on other outcomes too; for example, without behavioral responses, the tax reform lowers the net income share held by the top 10% by [0.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=72337&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) without behavioral responses, but [0.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=72338&region=ma&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) with them.

# Conclusion

In this report, we explain how PolicyEngine models two key behavioral responses:

1. Income effect for labor supply
   _Constant elasticity of -0.05_

1. Substitution effect for labor supply
   _Elasticity varying between 0.22 and 0.32 depending on income and whether the worker is primary or secondary within the household_

While we have focused on these two core elasticities, PolicyEngine continues to expand its behavioral modeling capabilities; for example, we are now working on adding capital gains responses. The platform’s flexibility allows users to customize behavioral response assumptions, including labor supply elasticities, enabling a more nuanced analysis of public policy impacts.

# PolicyEngine US in 2024: A year in review
Slug: us-year-in-review-2024
Date: 2024-12-29 09:00:00
Authors: Max Ghenis, Nikhil Woodruff
Tags: us, year-in-review, featured
Description: From state-level modeling to AI-powered analysis, we expanded the frontier of policy research through technology.

---

In 2024, PolicyEngine US achieved significant milestones in democratizing policy analysis through technological innovation and comprehensive coverage of major policy developments. Together with our [achievements in the UK](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-year-in-review-2024), we've expanded the frontier of evidence-based policymaking on both sides of the Atlantic.Here’s a detailed look at our achievements and impact this year.

## Evolving the platform

Our platform underwent major technological advances to enhance both capability and accessibility. We launched the [Enhanced Current Population Survey dataset](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta), which leverages machine learning to provide more accurate microsimulation modeling. This advancement allows for more precise analysis of policy impacts across different demographic groups.

We introduced comprehensive [state income tax models](https://policyengine.org/us/research/state-tax-model-beta) for all 50 states and DC, enabling analysis of state-specific reforms and their interaction with federal policy.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uDx8olHGnjSz4CbK)

Our new [behavioral response capabilities](https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-behavioral-response) capture how policy reforms affect labor supply based on customizable elasticities, enabling more nuanced analysis of how tax and benefit changes influence individual economic decisions.

This fall, we launched our [AI-powered tax and benefit explanations system](https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-household-ai), which translates complex calculations into clear, understandable language. This feature makes policy analysis more accessible to users regardless of their technical background.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*i6vTPu1E2W-ujch_)

## Informing the electorate

During this election year, we developed comprehensive analyses of major policy proposals, including a [calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/2024-election-calculator) showing the personal impacts of presidential candidates’ tax plans. We analyzed Harris’ [Child Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-ctc) and [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-eitc) expansions, as well as Trump’s [Social Security tax exemption](https://policyengine.org/us/research/social-security-tax-exemption) and [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act extension](https://policyengine.org/us/research/tcja-extension). Our analysis extended to state-level policies, including the [Oregon Rebate ballot measure](https://policyengine.org/us/research/oregon-rebate).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*kPmEReMyo2sa9vZ-)

## Expanding benefit access and personal tax insights

We broadened our suite of specialized calculators and tools in 2024, launching the country’s first standalone [Child Tax Credit calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/child-tax-credit-calculator) and introducing [GiveCalc](https://policyengine.org/us/research/givecalc) to help donors understand the tax implications of their charitable contributions. Our API now powers innovative services like [MyFriendBen](https://www.myfriendben.org/), which received a [$2.4 million grant](http://awarded) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and [Benefit Navigator](https://www.imaginela.org/benefit-navigator), which serves over 500 case managers across Los Angeles County.

## Growing our impact

Our research and tools gained recognition across sectors throughout 2024. We presented our work at major academic conferences including the National Tax Association Spring Symposium and Annual Conference, APPAM, BenCon, and the Open Sustainability Summit. Universities including UC Berkeley, Northwestern University, and George Mason University invited us to share our research.

Our analysis informed policy discussions at various levels, from Congress — where Rep. Morgan McGarvey [referenced our work](https://mcgarvey.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-morgan-mcgarvey-introduces-young-adult-tax-credit-act) in the Young Adult Tax Credit Act — to think tanks, with organizations like the Niskanen Center utilizing our tools for [policy analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research/niskanen-center-analysis).

## Planning for a transformative 2025

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*M-rBYeowks-1OEkn)

Looking ahead to 2025, we’re expanding our capabilities with API access to our AI-powered explanation system launching in Q1. We’ll continue enhancing our state-level analysis capabilities, expanding behavioral response modeling, and developing additional policy reform calculators to further democratize sophisticated policy analysis, especially in a critical year full of tax and benefit policy debates at all levels of government.

# Analysis of the Family First Act

Description: We project that Representative Blake Moore's Child Tax Credit bill would raise revenue and reduce poverty.

---

On January 13th, Congressman Blake Moore (R-UT) [introduced](https://blakemoore.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-blake-moore-introduces-legislation-to-enhance-the-child-tax-credit-and-provide-tax-relief-for-parents) the [Family First Act (FFA)](https://blakemoore.house.gov/imo/media/doc/ctc_bill_text.pdf), which would reform several tax provisions starting in 2026 after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires. The reform primarily expands the Child Tax Credit and extends the cap on state and local tax deductions, while also repealing dependent exemptions and head of household filing status, and reforming the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child and Dependent Care Credit. This analysis uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to estimate its impacts on household incomes, poverty, inequality, and federal revenue.

## Defining the Reform

Here we describe each provision of the Family First Act. See **Table A.1** in the Appendix for a detailed comparison of FFA, current policy (under TCJA), and current law (post-TCJA).

### Child Tax Credit (CTC)

The FFA expands the CTC from $1,000 to $4,200 for children up to age five and $3,000 for children ages six to 17, up to six children per filer. It phases in from $0 to $20,000 of earnings and phases out at 5% above $200,000 ($400,000 joint), retaining the TCJA thresholds of 2018–2025. Under current law in 2026, the threshold would revert to $75,000 ($110,000 joint).

### Pregnant Mother’s Credit

The FFA adds a pregnant mother’s credit of up to $2,800 for each newborn. It phases in until $10,000 of earnings.

### Reform of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

The FFA consolidates eight existing EITC household types (single/married and 0/1/2/3+ children) into four (single/married and 0/1+ children). The phase-in rate remains 7.65% for households without children and 34% for those with children. The phase-out rate becomes 10% for households without children and 25% for households with children, compared to 7.65% and up to 21.06% today.

### Repeal of Head of Household Filing Status

The FFA repeals head of household filing status, which increases tax thresholds for single parents under current policy.

### Repeal of Dependent Exemptions

The TCJA repealed dependent exemptions from 2018 to 2025. Starting in 2026, these exemptions would return at $5,300. The FFA continues their repeal, maintaining the TCJA approach.

### Repeal Child Portion of the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)

The FFA limits the CDCC to dependent care expenses for individuals who are 18 or older and unable to self-care due to disability. Currently, the CDCC is available for children under 13.

### Cap the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction

The $10,000 SALT deduction cap from the TCJA is scheduled to expire in 2026. The FFA would keep the $10,000 cap in place.

## Household Impacts of the Family First Act

Consider a single parent with two children, ages five and ten, earning $30,000 in Utah. Under the FFA, [household net income increases by $1,835](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565). The increase comes from a $5,395 expansion in the Child Tax Credit, partially offset by reductions in tax credits and increased tax liability. The federal EITC falls by $1,688, and the Utah EITC, which matches the federal credit, decreases by $338. The household pays $1,854 more in tax before credits due to the elimination of both dependent exemptions and head of household filing status.

Figure 1 shows how this household's experience [varies with income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565). Net income rises until earnings reach $188,000, after which the gains diminish and eventually become losses. At $350,000 of earnings, the household faces its largest reduction in net income of $5,900.

![Figure 1: FFA effect on net income for a single parent in Utah with two children ages 5 and 10](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*x8MiEDhoh0QJu5gI)

Figure 2 shows how the reform [alters the household's marginal tax rates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565), particularly if they earn under $50,000, where more programs change such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and dependent exemptions.

![Figure 2: FFA effect on marginal tax rates for a single parent in Utah with two children ages 5 and 10](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*karwlvhwpukVHknG)

The reform's effects vary with marital status, number of children, income, and childcare expenses. Figure 3 shows how these factors affect the impact to net income, holding child ages at ages 6 to 12. These impacts differ from those in Figure 1 as they assume (a) all children are age 6 and 12 (rather than 5 and 10), and (b) the household is in Texas, which has no income tax or credits (rather than Utah).

![Figure 3: FFA effect on net income by marital status, children, income, and childcare expenses](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2656/0*lKs_ij6_V1sEyJdU)

Single-parent households can see net income decrease by up to $10,000, or more with childcare expenses, with the largest reductions occurring at incomes between $300,000 and $400,000. The magnitude of change increases with the number of children in the household. Married households, in contrast, experience net income increases of up to $4,000-$5,000 until their earnings exceed $400,000. As with single-parent households, those with more children see larger changes in net income due to the expanded Child Tax Credit.

When households have childcare expenses, the impacts shift. A household with $10,000 in childcare expenses sees up to $3,000 less in net income due to changes in the Child and Dependent Care Credit. Married households maintain net gains until reaching about $420,000 in earnings, after which the gains gradually decline. Single households experience a steeper decline in net income as earnings grow, reflecting the reformed EITC structure.

## National Impacts of the Family First Act

We estimate national impacts using the PolicyEngine US microsimulation model. See Appendix B for methodological details.

### Federal Revenue Effects

The FFA raises [$20 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) in net federal revenue in 2026.
While the Child Tax Credit expansion (including the pregnant mother's credit) costs $170 billion, other provisions raise $190 billion-—primarily the SALT deduction cap which raises $111 billion. Figure 4 shows the revenue impact of each provision.

![Figure 4: Federal budgetary impacts of Family First Act provisions in 2026](/images/posts/family-first-act/FFA-waterfall.png)

Over the 2025-2034 budget window, the reform raises $505 billion, with federal revenue gains growing each year as shown in Figure 5.

![Figure 5: Federal budgetary impacts of Family First Act from 2025 to 2034](/images/posts/family-first-act/FFA-10-year-impact.png)

### State Revenue Effects

State revenues rise by [$3.9 billion in 2026](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2), largely from state-level credits that match federal amounts. States such as Colorado (25%), Connecticut (40%), Louisiana (5%), and others provide income tax credits that matching the federal EITC amount by varying percentages. Additionally, states such as Arkansas (20%), Colorado (up to 50%), Delaware (50%), and others match the federal CDCC amount under state-specific Child and Dependent Care Income Tax Credits. We consider these state impacts in the following distributional analysis.

### Changes in Income Distribution

The reform affects household incomes across the income distribution, as shown in Figure 6. [Net income rises for 36% of people and falls for 16%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2). The ninth income decile sees the highest share of households with income gains (47%), while the top decile has the highest share with income losses (49%).

![Figure 6: Distribution of gains and losses](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*f-gK9uscrzd-5170)

### Poverty Reduction

The reform [reduces poverty by 5.9%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) overall (a 1.5 percentage point reduction in the Supplemental Poverty Measure). As shown in Figure 7, child poverty falls by 10.7%, while deep poverty—households below half the poverty line—declines by 2.1%.

![Figure 7: Poverty reduction by age group](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Xp698QhswZMUp5u6)

The reform also reduces income inequality, [lowering the Gini index by 1.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2). The share of total income held by the top 1% of households falls by 3.1%.

Finally, the reform increases the [prevalence of cliffs](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=73854&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) by 0.07% and reduces the severity of cliffs by 0.2%.

## Conclusion

Congressman Blake Moore’s Family First Act modifies multiple tax policies. The bill changes the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Child and Dependent Care Credit, and SALT deduction, and it repeals head of household filing status and dependent exemptions. We project that these reforms would raise $505 billion in federal revenues from 2026 to 2034, with the amount increasing annually. According to our simulation, the reform raises net income for 36% of the population and reduces poverty by 5.9% (and child poverty by 10.7%).

## Appendix B: Simulation Methodology

### Data and Software

This analysis uses:

- PolicyEngine US version 1.172.0 microsimulation model
- Enhanced Current Population Survey microdata
- 2026 tax parameters from current law
- [This specialized code](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/analysis-notebooks/tree/main/us/family_first_act)

### Key Assumptions

The simulation:

- Compares FFA to current law baseline after TCJA expiration
- Assumes no behavioral responses to policy changes
- Models full CTC takeup
- Models partial EITC takeup based on [IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service estimates](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JRC20_Volume3.pdf#page=62)
- Includes state tax interactions where credits match federal amounts; distributional impacts consider state impacts, while budgetary impacts break out federal from state
- Projects parameters forward using statutory inflation adjustments and CBO inflation forecasts

### Margin of Error

Results are point estimates from survey microdata. Sampling error and modeling uncertainty affect precision. Key sources of uncertainty include:

- CPS sampling variation
- Income and demographic reporting error
- Tax filing unit construction from households
- Benefit takeup assumptions
- Economic projection uncertainty
- Behavioral responses

# The New York Working Families Tax Credit
Slug: ny-wftc
Date: 2025-01-21 09:00:00
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, policy, featured, us-ny
Description: A comprehensive analysis of the proposal from New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes.

---

In 2023, New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a proposal to combine several of the state’s family tax policies into the New York Working Families Tax Credit (NY WFTC). The expanded and fully refundable NY WFTC would provide up to $1,822 per child once fully implemented. Using PolicyEngine, we analyzed the potential impacts of the latest version of the proposal, [Senate Bill S277C](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S277/amendment/C), for tax years 2025 through 2029. We measured the bill’s effects on the New York state budget, household income, poverty, and more.

## What is the NY WFTC?

New York currently offers multiple family tax benefits to its residents. These include:

- [The Empire State Child Credit](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/credits/empire_state_child_credit.htm) (ESCC), which matches 33% of the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC) amount as it existed prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expansion ($1,000, therefore a maximum NY benefit of $330), also includes a minimum benefit of $100 for lower-income families.

- [New York’s Earned Income Tax Credit](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/credits/earned_income_credit.htm) (EITC), which matches the federal EITC by 30%.

- [New York’s Dependent Exemption](<https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I50e79907cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=StatuteNavigator&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1>), which allows households to exempt $1,000 per dependent from their taxable income.

Senate Bill S277C would introduce the WFTC, immediately replace the ESCC, and shrink the NY EITC and dependent exemption over the course of five years.

The fully refundable WFTC would initiate at a level of $550 per child under 17, rising yearly until reaching $1,600 in year five (adjusted for inflation). The new credit would also begin phasing out above a threshold at a 2% rate. For example, if a filer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold by $1,000, their credit would be reduced by $20. The threshold in year one would be $75,000, or $110,000 for joint filers. However, the thresholds would be lowered throughout the first five years, finally settling at $28,462/$56,924 in year five. The benefit would phase out until reaching $0 in the first year, but beginning in year two, a minimum benefit of $100 would be established. Additionally, in year four the NY WFTC would become available to 17-year-olds.

As the NY WFTC phases in, the New York EITC would phase out over five years, to the extent that it overlaps with the WFTC. Households with no children can continue to claim a 30% match for the childless EITC assuming they are within the income range. Moreover, families with older dependents who are eligible for the EITC but not the WFTC also continue to receive a 30% match.[^1]

Similarly, in year two, the bill would limit the dependent exemption to dependents not qualifying for the NY WFTC. In year four when the NY WFTC is expanded to 17-year-olds, they will no longer be eligible for the dependent exemption.

Table 1 displays how each policy changes by year, with 2025 as the first year of the bill’s implementation.

## Household Impacts

The NY WFTC will affect households across the income spectrum in various ways. To understand the implications, let’s examine how each provision of Senate Bill S277C will impact specific family units during the proposal’s implementation period.

Let’s begin with married college students with no earnings and a young child. This couple does not receive the NY EITC or the dependent exemption, as they generate no earnings. However, the couple currently qualifies for the $100 minimum of the ESCC. Therefore, in year one, when the NY WFTC is set at $550 and the ESCC is eliminated, their net income grows by $450. By 2029, their net income will rise by $1,722 as the WFTC reaches $1,822.

Another household to consider is a single parent with one child earning near the full-time minimum wage in New York City ($33,000 per year). This family currently receives assistance from all three provisions. In year one, they will lose their full ESCC of $330 and their EITC will shrink by $139. As they receive the $550 WFTC, their net income rises by $81. In 2029, they lose their $1,000 dependent exemption, and since this household falls within the 5.5% income tax bracket, their state income taxes climb by $55. Additionally, the family becomes subject to the WFTC phaseout as the household’s income exceeds the $28,462 threshold in 2029. Overall, the single parent’s net income grows by $313 as the reduction of various policies is offset by the WFTC reaching its full value. However, this net income change is without accounting for New York City income tax. Once considering NYC taxes, the household’s change in net income falls to a gain of $299 ($14 difference) due to the changes in the dependent exemption.[^2]

Finally, let’s look at a married couple with two kids earning near the median household income in New York ($80,000). Under current law, they receive the ESCC and the dependent exemptions for both children but do not qualify for the NY EITC as their income is too high. In 2025, the couple’s net income will increase by $440 as they lose $660 from the ESCC but gain $1,100 from the WFTC. In 2029, the family loses $110 from the bill’s dependent exemption change, while their WFTC allotment increases even as they become subject to the benefit phaseout, resulting in net income growth of $2,412.

Below is a table displaying the change in net income of the examined households for tax years 2025 and 2029:

**Table 2: Impact of Senate S277C on Various Households**

|        Household Composition         |                                                          Change in Net Income for Tax Year 2025                                                          |                                                           Change in Net Income for Tax Year 2029                                                           |

Due to the reduction of the NY EITC over time in Senate Bill S277C, households receiving the EITC’s maximum benefit see the smallest change in net income compared to families with very low incomes and households above the EITC range. To visualize this trend, Figures 3 and 4 below demonstrate how net income changes for a single parent with one child based on household income for 2025 and 2029, respectively.

**Figure 3: Change in Net Income for a Single Parent with One Child Based on Household Income (2025)**

**Figure 4: Change in Net Income for a Single Parent with One Child Based on Household Income (2029)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*_Dg7chnu3CO0Q79Y)

In addition to their change in net income, each household’s marginal tax rates would change. Below are the changes in these rates in 2025 and 2029 for the same household example above.

**Figure 5: Change in Marginal Tax Rates for a Single Parent with One Child Based on Household Income (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bL2a37ZlTWQyQ8a8)

For both years, the household’s marginal tax rates will increase as income is below $14,000 due to the NY EITC’s phase-in reduction. However, marginal tax rates decrease as the household’s earnings fall into the NY EITC’s phase-out range. Furthermore, small increases in marginal tax rates occur as households enter new state income tax brackets due to dependent exemption changes.

Using PolicyEngine’s microsimulation capabilities through 3 years of pooled data (2021–2023) from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we can estimate the impact of Senate Bill S277C on the state of New York.[^3]

## Statewide Impact in 2025

[PolicyEngine estimates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) that the NY WFTC would in 2025:

- Cost $660 million

- Lower poverty by 1.6% and child poverty by 4.0%

- Increase net income for 31% of New Yorkers

**Figure 1: Winners and Losers from the NY WFTC by Income Decile (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*SICGa9ii5d7HiCNy9xiocw.png)

In 2025, the NY WFTC would benefit 30.7% of New York residents as the initial maximum benefit of the NY WFTC ($550) exceeds the existing Empire State Child Credit ($330). This translates to an increase in average net income [across all income deciles](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) and a reduction in [poverty and child poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) of 1.6% and 4.0%, respectively, applying the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Furthermore, higher-income households are unaffected in 2025 as the WFTC’s minimum benefit and Senate Bill S277C’s changes to the dependent exemption do not come into effect until 2026.

## Statewide Impact in 2029

[PolicyEngine estimates](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2029&baseline=2) that the NY WFTC would in 2029:

- Cost $3.1 billion

- Lower poverty by 6.1% and child poverty by 16.8%

- Increase net income for 34.4% of New York residents

**Figure 2: Winners and Losers from the NY WFTC by Income Decile (2029)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*qp0po4EGMoqHejBO9Y-HTw.png)

Once the NY WFTC phases in completely for tax year 2029, a greater percentage of New York residents will see their net income [increase by more than 5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2029&baseline=2). Additionally, the reduction in [poverty and child poverty](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2029&baseline=2) grows significantly as the maximum benefit of the NY WFTC rises. Deep child poverty would [drop by 22.0%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=72622&region=ny&timePeriod=2029&baseline=2) in 2029 as well. To see the impact of Senate Bill S277C for all years of implementation, see Appendix A (statewide) and Appendix B (New York City).

## Conclusion

Senate Bill S277C and the creation of the NY WFTC would partially consolidate New York’s family tax policies while disproportionately benefiting lower-income families. In the first year of implementation, the NY WFTC would cost $660 million while benefiting 30.7% of households and lowering child poverty by 4.0%. Once fully phased in, New York’s tax revenue would decrease by $3.1 billion, without any offsets. The poverty impact would rise as the state’s Supplemental Poverty Measure would drop by 6.1% and child poverty would fall by 16.8%.

## Appendix B: Impact of Senate Bill S277C for Tax Years 2025–2029 in NYC

From 2025 to 2029, the WFTC would provide $3.9 billion in tax benefits to New York City residents, or 43% of the total state costs. New York City residents are disproportionately likely to gain from the reform. While the WFTC reduces poverty relatively less in NYC than outside NYC, it reduces deep poverty relatively more.

[^1]: In addition to the discussed exceptions for the NY EITC under Senate Bill S277C, [households with both WFTC qualifying dependents and older dependents](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S277/amendment/C) would continue to receive their full EITC until year five (2029), at which point they would receive the more generous WFTC for dependents who qualify and the EITC only for older dependents who are outside of the WFTC qualifying ages.

[^2]: Since the household loses its dependent exemption, its taxable income in NYC rises, thus creating a higher tax liability of $16. Additionally, the NYC school credit is tied to AGI, and for the examined household the credit’s value increases by $2, contributing to an overall net income difference of $14 compared to if the household was outside of NYC.

Description: Analysis of Senate Bill S2238, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes.

---

As New York’s legislative session progresses, lawmakers are proposing various changes to the state’s income tax code. [Senate Bill S2238](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2238), sponsored by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, would establish a New York City Child Tax Credit (NYC CTC) while restructuring the existing School Tax Credit (STC) to raise revenue to offset the cost of the NYC CTC. Using PolicyEngine’s household calculator and microsimulation capabilities, this analysis examines the specific effects of Senate Bill S2238 on individual families as well as its impact on the budget, income distribution, and poverty.

[PolicyEngine projects](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) that in 2025, Senate Bill S2238 would:

- Generate $93.3 million in state revenue

- Affect 57% of NYC residents, with 32% seeing increased net income and 25% seeing decreased net income

- Lower poverty by 0.8% and child poverty by 2.0%

- Reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.3%

## Background

The School Tax Credit, like other tax credits available to New York City residents, is administered through the New York State tax system. While these credits specifically benefit residents of NYC, they are funded at the state level as part of New York State’s broader tax and revenue structure. New York City income tax revenue flows to the state’s tax administration before funds are allocated back to the city through various programs and credits. The current STC structure consists of two components that vary based on filing status and income level:

1. The **fixed amount** provides $63 ($125 for joint and surviving spouse filers) to filers with state AGI at $250,000 or less.

2. The **rate reduction amount** increases with taxable income and is limited to filers with taxable income below $500,000. For filers with taxable income below $12,000 ($21,600 for joint filers and $14,400 for heads of households), the rate reduction amount equals 0.171% of taxable income; above that threshold, it equals 0.228% of taxable income.

Figure 1 shows the total amount of the School Tax Credit for a single filer based on household income.

**Figure 1: NYC School Tax Credit for a Single Filer Based on Household Income**

Senate Bill S2238 would reduce the School Tax Credit at $5 per $100 of earnings exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint and surviving spouse filers). The proposed structure of the STC can be seen in Figure 2 below.

At the same time, the legislation would introduce a $300 fully refundable Child Tax Credit for NYC residents with children under the age of 18. This credit would also phase out at 5%, starting at $75,000 and $150,000.

## Household Impacts

The impact of Senate Bill S2238 varies based on household composition and income level. To understand this, let’s examine different family examples and how the proposal changes their net income.

_See how a New York City Child Tax Credit would affect your household with our [personalized calculator](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2)._

**Table 1: Impact of Senate Bill S2238 on Various Household Compositions**

| Household Composition             | Baseline School Tax Credit | New School Tax Credit | NYC CTC | Change in Net Income                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single, No Children, \$50,000** | \$152                      | \$152                 | \$0     | [\$0](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50900)    |
| **Single, No Children, \$85,000** | \$232                      | \$0                   | \$0     | [-\$232](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50993) |
| **Single, One Child, \$50,000**   | \$152                      | \$152                 | \$300   | [+\$300](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) |
| **Single, One Child, \$85,000**   | \$221                      | \$0                   | \$0     | [-\$221](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50997) |

A single adult with $50,000 in earnings and zero children would continue to receive their current School Tax Credit at $152[^1] as their income is below the phaseout threshold of $75,000. Additionally, because they have no children, they are ineligible for the NYC CTC, leaving their net income unchanged. However, if their earnings increase to $85,000, their STC would phase out completely, reducing their net income by $232 (what they would otherwise receive from the STC if Senate Bill S2238 were not implemented).

For a single parent of one making $50,000 a year, their net income would increase by $300 as their STC would also remain unchanged at $152, but they would now receive the $300 NYC CTC. The STC phases out from $75,000 to $78,040 of earnings, and the CTC phases out from $75,000 to $81,000, so at $85,000 of earnings, their net income falls by $221.[^2] Figure 3 displays the change in net income for a single parent with one child under Senate Bill S2238, while Figure 4 shows how marginal tax rates are affected.

**Figure 3: Change in Net Income for a Single Parent of One Child Under Senate Bill S2238 Based on Household Income**

**Figure 4: Change in Marginal Tax Rates for a Single Parent with One Child Based on Household Income**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*zr1iDLDWQX0olKas)

In summation, households with no children are unaffected if their earnings are less than $75,000 (or $150,000 if filing jointly). Households with children below these thresholds would receive an additional $300 for each child under 18. Above these thresholds, the credits gradually phase out, but families with children would remain better off until reaching their “breakeven point” — where the change in net income becomes zero before turning negative. Beyond the breakeven point, a family’s net income decreases until their taxable income reaches $500,000, at which point their change in net income returns to zero since they do not qualify for the current School Tax Credit or any proposed changes. Table 2 displays the breakeven points for single and married households with zero to four children.

**Table 2: Breakeven Points by Household Composition**

| Number of Children |                                                                           Single                                                                           |                                                                           Married                                                                           |

_Rounded to the nearest $100._

Using PolicyEngine’s microsimulation capabilities through 3 years of pooled data (2021–2023) from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we can also estimate the impact of Senate Bill S2238 on New York City at large.

## Citywide Impacts

Phasing out the School Tax Credit would raise [$427.1 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=74345&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2) in 2025, while implementing the CTC component of Senate Bill S2238 would cost [$333.8 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=75446&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), generating a [surplus of $93.3 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) in state funds.

As displayed in Figure 5, the proposed legislation provides net benefits to the [bottom six income deciles](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) on average, while the seventh decile is essentially unchanged. Conversely, households in the top income decile would see an average reduction of $551.

Furthermore, while the average dollar amount gained in each decile in the bottom half of the distribution would vary, households in these deciles would see their net income increase [between 0.2% and 0.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50900) on average.

**Figure 5: Average Benefit of Senate Bill S2238 by Income Decile[^3]**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*H404oqvkm7Am75Cjq_ugAQ.png)

Fourteen percent of residents in the [first income decile](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) would gain more than 5% of their net income with the proposed legislation. This is a larger portion of residents receiving over a 5% net gain in any other decile (see the dark blue portion of the bars in Figure 6). Seventy-two percent of NYC residents in the top decile would see a loss that is less than 5% of their net income.

**Figure 6: Winners and Losers of Senate Bill S2238**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*USRzlHzR5BOrM0310ZIgyg.png)

Senate Bill S2238 would lower the city’s Supplemental Poverty Measure [by 0.8%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=50953) and child poverty by 2.0%. PolicyEngine projects the legislation would have no impact on deep poverty.

**Figure 7: Poverty Impact of Senate Bill S2238**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KHmC00tZhNNzIwEqWckwmw.png)

Finally, the city’s Gini index of income inequality would [drop by 0.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=74381&region=nyc&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=51083).[^4]

## Conclusion

Senate Bill S2238 would limit the School Tax Credit by phasing out benefits at 5% beginning at $75,000 ($150,000 for joint and surviving spouse filers). The legislation would also establish a $300 NYC Child Tax Credit for children 17 and under, phasing out at the same parameters as the reformed STC. Childless households under the phaseout thresholds would be unaffected, while families with children below $75,000 ($150,000 for joint and surviving spouse filers) would gain $300 per eligible child. Senate Bill S2238 would raise $93.3 million in state revenues in 2025. 32% of NYC residents would see their net incomes increase, including 40% of those in the bottom half of the household income distribution. A quarter of the NYC population would see their tax liability increase. Finally, the city’s poverty level, as measured by the SPM, would decrease, including a 2.0% reduction in child poverty.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

We invite you to explore our [additional analyses](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/research) and use [PolicyEngine](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us) to calculate your own tax benefits or design custom policy reforms.

[^1]: The childless adult would receive the STC’s fixed amount of $63, plus the rate reduction portion. With $50,000 in annual earnings, their taxable income is $42,000 as they receive New York’s $8,000 standard deduction. 0.171% of the first $12,000 is $20.52. 0.228% of the remaining $30,000 is $68.40. Combined the rate reduction amount is around $89. $63 plus $89 is $152, the adult’s total STC.

[^2]: The School Tax Credit amounts for a childless adult and a single parent who earn $85,000 are not the same due to the differences of the phase in rate thresholds of the “rate reduction” portion of the STC. The childless adult is a single filer while the single parent can use the head of household filing status.

[^3]: Note that these income deciles are based on the national income distribution, rather than NYC income distribution.

[^4]: PolicyEngine’s analysis shows that Senate Bill S2238 would increase the share of total net income held by the top 1% of households by less than 0.1%. This may be a relative effect rather than an absolute benefit to the top 1%. Since households in the top 1% typically have taxable incomes above $500,000, they would be largely unaffected by the bill’s provisions. However, the bill would reduce total net income held by all New Yorkers (by raising $93.3 million net tax revenue), leaving the top 1%’s constant dollar value a larger share of the total.

# Kentucky Cuts Income Tax Rate

Date: 2025-02-26

Description: Analysis of lowering Kentucky's 4% income tax rate to 3.5%.

---

[On February 6](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-tax-cut), Governor Andy Beshear signed [House Bill 1](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/hb1.html), which reduces Kentucky's flat income tax from a rate of 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. The bill previously passed the Kentucky House of Representatives with a [vote of 90–7](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-legislature-tax) and the Senate with a [34–3 vote](https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-income-tax).

We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect these changes and analyzed their effects on the state of Kentucky and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

- Reduces state revenues by $684 million

- Benefits 73% of Kentucky residents

- Lowers the state's Supplemental Poverty Measure by 1.3%

- Increases the Gini index of income inequality by 0.14%

_Use PolicyEngine to [view the full results](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) or calculate the [effect on your household](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143)._

## Household Impacts

To understand the extent of this reform, it is important to note that higher-income households receive larger tax savings because they have more taxable income and therefore higher initial tax liability. For example, a childless adult earning $20,000 in Kentucky gains $58 from the 0.5pp rate reduction, while they would gain $483 if they earned $100,000, or $1,664 if they earned $500,000.

**Table 1: Change in Net Income by Household Income for a Single Adult**

| Household Earnings |                                                                    Change in Net Income                                                                    |
| :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      $20,000       |  [\+$58](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143&household=51467)   |
|      $100,000      |  [\+$483](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143&household=51470)  |
|      $500,000      | [\+$1,664](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143&household=51468) |

Below, Figure 1 displays the reduction in Kentucky income tax for a childless adult between $0 and $500,000 of household earnings. Since Kentucky's Family Size Credit fully offsets state tax liability for those below the federal poverty line, childless adults with income below $16,040 in 2026 will not benefit from the tax cut.[^1]

**Figure 1: Change in Kentucky Income Tax for a Single Adult by Household Income**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*5p5Z-BS8sXYHB_iH)

## Statewide Impacts

Using PolicyEngine static modeling, the individual income tax rate reduction enacted in Kentucky will [cost the state $684 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) for tax year 2026. The measure would also increase federal revenues by $48 million, as residents would have less state income tax to take as an itemized deduction. On net, the tax cut would increase residents' net income by $636 million, without considering behavioral responses.

**Figure 2: Budgetary Impact of Kentucky's Income Tax Cut**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*K9gfVVMZgO36y7L_)

73% of Kentuckians will see an [increase in their net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143), including 99% of those in the top income decile and 6% of those in the bottom decile.

**Figure 3: Winners of Kentucky's Income Tax Cut by Decile**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*c3r5UopZtVsyE3CZ)

The tax cut will provide an [average benefit of $335](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) per household, ranging from $5 in the bottom income decile to $1,470 in the top decile.

**Figure 4: Income Distribution of Kentucky's Income Tax Cut by Decile**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*thDpBTm7YsAjCpGU)

The tax changes are projected to [reduce Kentucky's poverty rate by 1.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143), applying the Supplemental Poverty Measure, while leaving deep poverty unchanged. The income tax reduction will also increase the state's Gini index of income inequality [by 0.14%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143).

## Conclusion

The 0.5pp rate reduction of Kentucky's income tax will lower state revenues by $684 million in 2026, while reducing poverty by 1.3% and increasing income inequality by 0.14%. The reform reduces tax liability for households across all income deciles, with higher-income households receiving larger benefits on both an [absolute](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) and [relative](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&reform=2&region=ky&timePeriod=2026&baseline=76143) basis.

# The Family Income Supplemental Credit (FISC) Act
Slug: fisc-act
Date: 2025-03-05
Authors: Pavel Makarchuk
Tags: us, policy, featured
Description: Representative Jared Golden’s Child Tax Credit reform would cost $193 billion in 2026 while reducing poverty and inequality.

---

The [Family Income Supplemental Credit (FISC) Act](https://golden.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/golden.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/GoldenFISC.pdf), introduced by Representative Jared Golden (D-ME), would establish a new refundable tax credit for families with children of various ages. Using PolicyEngine’s household calculator and microsimulation capabilities, this analysis examines the specific effects of the FISC Act on individual families as well as its impact on the federal budget, income distribution, and poverty.

PolicyEngine projects that in 2026, the FISC Act would:

- Reduce federal tax revenue by $193 billion

- Increase net income for 37% of US residents

- Lower the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 9.2% and child poverty by 17.7%

## Background

The FISC Act would create a new refundable family income supplement credit with the following structure:

1. A monthly base credit amount of $400 per child under six or $250 per child over six or under eighteen years of age

1. An additional monthly $400 for pregnant mothers after the first five pregnancy months

1. A 20% marriage bonus, which is applied to the total monthly credit amount

The credit phases in linearly with earnings and phases out monthly by $16.67 for each $1,000 increment of adjusted gross income over $125,000 ($250,000 for joint filers).

This new credit’s cost is partially offset by the repeal of the existing Child Tax Credit.

## Household Impacts

Considering a married couple in Virginia with $40,000 of earnings and two children aged 3 and 10. Under the FISC Act, [household net income increases](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=76612&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51530) by $7,360. This household will receive a family income supplement credit of $9,360, receiving a base credit of $7,800 with a 20% marriage bonus. Simultaneously this household would lose their Child Tax Credit of $2,000, where $1,780 is refundable and $220 is non-refundable (the maximum per-child CTC falls from $2,000 in 2025 to $1,000 in 2026 under current law).

Figure 1 shows how this household’s experience [varies with net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=76612&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51530). The family income supplement credit phases in at a steeper rate than the current CTC, reaching the maximum amount at earnings of $9,400 while the CTC is fully phased-in at earnings levels of $17,000. Furthermore, the CTC fully phases out at earnings of $110,000 while the family income supplement credit does not start to phase out until $250,000 for joint filers.

Figure 2. shows how the FISC Act alters the household’s marginal tax rates, with the steeper phase-in structure being reflected in the earnings up to $17,000.

The new credit amount varies with children’s ages while adding an additional pregnancy credit amount. Figure 3 shows the impacts of this credit on net income of a single parent with one child of varying ages. We currently lump four months of the $400 pregnancy credit in with 12 months of the $400 base credit for parents of newborns, applying the full $6,400 in the same year, though we [will improve this](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/5659).

## National Impacts

Using PolicyEngine’s microsimulation capabilities, and assuming no behavioral responses, we estimate the national impacts of the FISC Act in the 2026 fiscal year.

The FISC Act would reduce federal revenues by [$193.1 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=76612&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51531) in 2026, or $1,293 per household. On average, households in the ninth income decile gain the most ($2,489), while those in the bottom decile gain the least ($390).

**Figure 4: Average Change in Net Income by Income Decile in 2026**

**Table 1: 10-Year Budgetary Impact of the FISC Act**
| Tax Year | Static Impact ($bn) | Dynamic Impact ($bn) |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 2026 | -193.1 | -217.4 |
| 2027 | -194.5 | -218.4 |
| 2028 | -195.5 | -219.7 |
| 2029 | -196.3 | -216.6 |
| 2030 | -197.0 | -219.2 |
| 2031 | -197.1 | -224.8 |
| 2032 | -196.3 | -227.4 |
| 2033 | -194.7 | -225.6 |
| 2034 | -193.1 | -227.6 |
| 2035 | -190.0 | -230.4 |
| Total | -1,947.6 | -2,227.1 |

37% of US residents would gain: 50% of those in the sixth decile and 14% of those in the upper decile representing the extrema.

## Poverty Impact

The FISC Act would lower the nation’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by [9.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=76612&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51531) and child poverty by 17.7%. PolicyEngine projects the legislation would reduce deep poverty by [11.7%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&reform=76672&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51531).

## Conclusion

Representative Golden’s FISC Act would replace the Child Tax Credit with a larger credit that varies with child age and marital status, and introduce a pregnancy credit. It would cost $193 billion in 2026, providing larger benefits to households in the middle of the income distribution than those in the top or bottom deciles. Without considering behavioral responses, it would reduce poverty and [income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=76612&baseline=2&timePeriod=2026&region=us&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=51531).

# New York Governor Hochul's Tax Proposals
Slug: ny-hochul-budget
Date: 2025-03-07
Authors: David Trimmer
Tags: us, us-ny, featured, policy
Description: PolicyEngine analyzed several individual income tax policies included in Governor Kathy Hochul's FY2026 budget.

---

On January 21, 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul [unveiled her budget](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/press/2025/fy26-executive-budget.html) for Fiscal Year 2026, including three provisions PolicyEngine can simulate:

- Introducing “inflation rebates” that would provide $300 to single filers with earnings of $150,000 or less and $500 for joint filers at $300,000 or below.

- Increasing the Empire State Child Credit (ESCC) to $1,000 for children under the age of 4 and to $500 for children 4 to 16.

- Cutting the first five tax brackets’ rates [by 0.2](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/FY2026-Executive-Budget-Briefing-Book.pdf#page=37) percentage points over two years.

Using PolicyEngine’s household calculator and microsimulation capabilities, we can project the effects of these proposals on individual families as well as the impacts on New York’s budget, statewide income distribution, and poverty rates.

## Background

### Inflation Rebates

The proposed inflation rebates would function as fully refundable tax credits as they would provide direct payments to households that have filed their taxes. The rebates’ value and income limit depend on filing status, as displayed in Table 1. Households above the limits would not receive the rebates, creating an income cliff. These payments would only be active for 2025.

**Table 1: Inflation Rebate Value and Income Limit by Filing Status**

| Filing Status                               | Rebate Amount | Income Limit |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Single and Head of Household                | $300          | $150,000     |
| Married Filing Jointly and Surviving Spouse | $500          | $300,000     |
| Married Filing Separately                   | $250          | $150,000     |

### Empire State Child Credit

In addition to the increase in the value of the ESCC, the maximum credit amount would also be extended to families with low incomes. Currently, a single parent with annual earnings of $5,000 or less receives only $100. Between $5,000 and $10,000, the ESCC phases into its current maximum of $330. Hochul’s proposal would eliminate the earnings requirement, allowing this single parent to receive the full credit. For tax year 2025, children under the age of 4 would see their credit increase from $330 to $1,000. Children between 4 and 16 would still receive $330, until 2026 when their credit is increased to $500. The current phase-out structure of the ESCC would remain, though the credit would no longer be coupled to the pre-TCJA federal CTC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2652/0*OHmEv_nybbouJJ0L)

### Income Tax Cuts

Finally, Governor Hochul would decrease the tax rate for New York state’s first five income tax brackets by 0.1% in 2025 and 2026. The rates under current law and the proposed cuts can be seen in Table 2 below.

**Table 2: Current Tax Rates and Proposed Cuts in 2025 and 2026**

| Tax Year | Tax Rate 1 | Tax Rate 2 | Tax Rate 3 | Tax Rate 4 | Tax Rate 5 |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 2024     | 4.0%       | 4.5%       | 5.25%      | 5.5%       | 6.0%       |
| 2025     | 3.9%       | 4.4%       | 5.15%      | 5.4%       | 5.9%       |
| 2026     | 3.8%       | 4.3%       | 5.05%      | 5.3%       | 5.8%       |

In addition to several other proposals, Governor Hochul also included an extension of the Temporary PIT High Income Surcharge from 2028 to 2032. We have limited this analysis to three provisions that have been discussed.

## Household Impacts

These three policies affect various family compositions across New York state. Let’s examine several examples to understand their impact on each household’s net income.

A non-earning single parent of a 6-year-old child is eligible for a $300 inflation rebate in 2025. Additionally, their ESCC increases by $230 as the minimum earning requirement is eliminated, making their allotment climb from $100 to $330. As they have no taxable income, they are unaffected by the income tax cuts, resulting in a change in net income of $530. In 2026, they no longer receive the inflation rebate, but their ESCC goes from $100 to $500, increasing their net income by $400.

For the same household composition but with an annual income of $50,000, they also receive the full $300 inflation rebate in 2025, as their income falls well below the $150,000 threshold. While they are already eligible for the maximum ESCC amount under current law, they benefit from the income tax cuts, which provide an additional $38 in tax relief. This results in a total increase in net income of $338 for 2025. In 2026, they see their ESCC increase by $170 as the credit for children aged 4–16 rises to $500, and they receive $76 in tax cuts, bringing their total benefit to $246.

A single parent with two children earning $160,000 exceeds the income threshold for the inflation rebate in 2025, making them ineligible for that benefit. Their income level also places them above the ESCC phase-out, so they receive no additional benefit from its expansion. However, they would see a $147 reduction in their tax liability for 2025. In 2026, their tax savings and net income will double to $294.

A married couple with three children earning $250,000 qualifies for the full $500 inflation rebate in 2025, as their income falls below the $300,000 joint filer threshold. While their income level excludes them from additional ESCC benefits, they receive $231 from the tax rate reductions, totaling $731 in increased net income for 2025. In 2026, without the inflation rebate, their benefit comes exclusively from the income tax cuts, providing $462 in tax relief.

If this married couple’s income grows to $310,000, they would exceed the joint filer threshold for the inflation rebate in 2025, receiving no benefit from this program. However, their benefit from the tax rate reductions would increase to $291 in 2025. In 2026, their tax liability would drop by $461, resulting in a gain in net income.[^1]

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the changes in each program and net income for each examined household for 2025 and 2026.

Figures 2 through 5 display the changes in net income and marginal tax rates for a single parent of two children, ages 3 and 6, (household example 3) based on their annual income (ranging from $0 to $500,000) in 2025 and 2026.

## Statewide Impacts 2025

For tax year 2025, PolicyEngine projects that these reforms would:

- [Cost $4.8 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580), with the following breakdown:

  - Inflation Rebates: [$3.7 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=76266&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2)[^2]

  - ESCC expansion: [$481 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=76581&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2)

  - Income tax cuts: [$623 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76590)

- Lower the state’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by 5.2%

- Reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.67%

- [Increase net income for 99.4%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580) of New York residents (all but 6% of those in the top decile), including an increase of 5% of net income for 51% of those in the bottom decile

These use PolicyEngine’s microsimulation capabilities through 3 years of pooled data (2021–2023) from the Current Population Survey (CPS), aged to the current year.

**Figure 6: Winners of Hochul’s Tax Proposals (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*3OEHXel8uNfoA62E)

The reform provides an average of [$611 per household in 2025](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580), varying based on income decile.[^3] Households in the ninth income bracket would receive $781, the highest average benefit of any decile. Though the first decile’s average benefit is the lowest at $404, it represents a [2.5% gain in net income](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580) for households, the largest percentage of any decile.

**Figure 7: Average Benefit Based on Household Income Decile (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*fvsjuJ247XGUaeju)

In 2025, these proposals would [reduce poverty by 5.2%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580) when applying the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The poverty reduction would disproportionally affect children as the child poverty rate would also decrease by 6.4%. Deep poverty and deep child poverty would [drop by 5.0% and 7.3%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580), respectively.

**Figure 8: Poverty Impact (2025)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*MYtaUAsZ0X6QzbO2)

Finally, the tax reforms would [decrease income inequality](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&reform=76580), lowering the state’s Gini index by 0.67% while also reducing the share of income held by the top 10% and 1% of households.

## Statewide Impacts 2026

For tax year 2026, PolicyEngine projects that these reforms would:

- Cost [$2.1 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580), with the following breakdown:

  - ESCC expansion: [$821 million](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=76581&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2)

  - Income tax cuts: [$1.3 billion](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76590)[^4]

- Increase net income for 83.5% of New York residents

- Lower the state’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by 2.5%

- Reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.24%

While both the ESCC expansion and income tax cuts provide more tax benefits to the New York population than they did in 2025, the expiration of the inflation rebates results in a lower impact in every major measurement for 2026. The reform [benefits 83.5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580) of residents in 2025, down from 99.4% in 2025. While 92% or more residents in the top half of the income distribution are net beneficiaries in 2026, 31% in the bottom income decile would see their net incomes increase; the remaining 69% would be unaffected.

**Figure 9: Winners of Hochul’s Tax Proposals (2026)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*rEnFxmyVpTrT0N9l)

The reform provides [$252 on average](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580) per household. While the range of average benefit by decile in 2025 was $404 to $781 (first to ninth decile), the 2026 range is $65 to $557 (first and tenth decile). As the inflation rebates expire and income tax cuts double, higher-income households would gain a larger share of the overall tax benefits as they have higher tax liabilities than lower-income families.

**Figure 10: Average Benefit Based on Household Income Decile**

In 2026, the reform would [reduce poverty by 2.5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580), down from 5.5% in 2025. However, it would lower child poverty more, from 6.4% in 2025 to 7.4% in 2026, likely due to the expansion of the ESCC. Deep poverty and deep child poverty impacts fall from 2025, [settling at 1.6% and 5.5%](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580), respectively.

Income inequality [would decrease](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&household=51448&region=ny&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&reform=76580) as it did in 2025. However, each inequality impact would be lower, including the Gini index (0.67% to 0.24%).

## Conclusion

Governor Hochul’s major tax proposals would send one-time inflation rebates to New York residents, expand the Empire State Child Credit to $1,000 for children under 4 and to $500 for all other eligible children, and reduce the first five state income tax brackets by 0.2 percentage points over two years. In 2025, these reforms would reduce state revenue by $4.8 billion. The combined impact of the tax provisions would affect 99.4% of New Yorkers, providing an average household benefit of $611. These changes would also lower poverty by 5.2% and child poverty by 6.4%.

The impact of these proposals would shrink in 2026. The total cost would amount to $2.1 billion, as ESCC increases to $500 for children aged 4–16 and income tax rates decrease by an additional 0.1 percentage point, while the inflation rebates expire. These changes would reduce poverty by 2.5% and child poverty by 7.4% while increasing net income for 83.5% of New Yorkers.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

[^1]: Once New York households reach a specific annual income, their state tax liability exceeds the value of the federal standard deduction, making itemizing their deductions (specifically claiming the State and Local Tax Deduction) more valuable. However, the alternative minimum tax effectively caps the SALT deduction’s value once the household reaches a certain income.

[^2]: We assume full take up for the inflation rebates (i.e., every filer under the income limits filed taxes in 2023 and is therefore eligible for the refund). This explains why PolicyEngine’s estimate of the inflation rebates is higher than one found in the Executive Budget ($3.0 million).

[^3]: PolicyEngine sorts households into deciles by baseline net income, with boundaries set nationally rather than within states.

[^4]: While the reduction of New York’s income taxes in 2026 would lower state revenues by $1.3 billion, it would also raise federal revenue. Currently, New Yorkers can report their state income tax liability to reduce their federal taxes when claiming the State and Local Tax Deduction. Since New Yorkers will have a lower state income tax liability under the reform, their federal tax owed will increase, thus increasing federal revenue by $128.9 million in 2026.

    "## How the EITC and TCWA work\n",
    "\n",
    "While the US provides the EITC to filers with and without qualifying children, it limits eligibility and reduces the amount for those without children. Such filers must be between ages 25 and 65, and the credit phases in at 7.65% of earnings until earnings reach $4,220 (in 2026). At $10,840 of adjusted gross income ($18,100 for joint filers), the credit is reduced with 7.65% of AGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, the US passed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which included an expansion to the EITC for filers without qualifying children. ARPA lowered the minimum age to 19 (24 for eligible students) and removed the maximum age. It also doubled the phase-in and phase-out rates to 15.3%, while increasing the earnings and AGI levels that governed the credit, thereby increasing the maximum credit value. It did not adjust the “married filing joint bonus”, an additional AGI level for joint filers before the credit starts phasing out. Read our report on the ARPA EITC [here](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TCWA restores ARPA’s EITC changes, while setting the dollar figures to their 2021 values starting in 2026 (rather than the values they would have been if ARPA were made permanent, due to inflation adjustments). Table 1 displays these parameter values under current law and TCWA as of 2026.\n"

The maximum net income increase occurs between earnings of $10,000 and $19,000 with a spike at $18,000, due to the higher phase-out start."

    "The Tax Cuts for Workers Act would cost the federal government $65.4 billion over the 2026-35 budget window, assuming no behavioral responses. Accounting for state and local tax impacts, which add 21% to the aggregate impact beyond the federal taxes, it increases net income for 10% of the population, with an average household increase of $59 ($590 per affected household). Households in the first and second income deciles would see the largest benefits ($95 and $91 respectively). The TCWA is projected to reduce poverty by 0.3% and the Gini index of income inequality by 0.05%.\n",

    "Idaho has undergone several tax reforms in recent years. However, in 2024, [Idaho has two tax brackets](https://tax.idaho.gov/taxes/income-tax/individual-income/individual-income-tax-rate-schedule/): one at 0% and another at 5.695%. For single filers, the 5.695% rate does not apply until their taxable income exceeds $4,673. House Bill 40 reduces the 5.695% rate to 5.3%. \n",

    "\n",
    "The two examined income tax changes have different effects on households based on their composition and earnings. Here, we consider some examples, as displayed in Table 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A childless adult with no earnings [will be unaffected by either tax provision](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=id&timePeriod=2025&baseline=80392&household=52245). Since single filers in Idaho can take a standard deduction of $14,600 and the top marginal tax rate does not go into effect until they have $4,673 of taxable income, a childless adult must earn $19,273 before their net income would be affected by the rate change. Additionally, since a childless adult with no earnings, but who meets [SNAP’s work requirements](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements) (ex., is participating in a work program at least 80 hours per month), is eligible for SNAP benefits, the increase in grocery tax credit does not change their net income either. They would have to earn over $20,000 to no longer qualify for SNAP and therefore be eligible for the grocery tax credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single parent with two kids earning $50,000 annually [will gain $176](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=id&timePeriod=2025&baseline=80392&household=52247). As their income excludes them from SNAP benefits, the household qualifies for the grocery tax credit, which increases by $35 per household member for a total of $105. Since the household's taxable income is subject to the reduced top marginal tax rate, their tax liability is reduced by $71.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an elderly couple with no children and $200,000 of annual earnings will see their [net income increase by $214](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=id&timePeriod=2025&baseline=80392&household=52252). Since each spouse was scheduled to receive $140 in grocery credits ($120 plus the $20 aged amount) and will now receive $155 each, their total allotment increases by $30. Additionally, the top marginal rate cut lowers their state income tax liability by $184. "

    "[On March 26,](https://governor.utah.gov/press/gov-cox-signs-100-bills-in-the-2025-general-legislative-session/) Governor Spencer Cox (R-UT) signed [HB106](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0106.html) and [SB71](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0071.html), bills that amend Utah’s individual income tax code. HB106 reduces the state’s flat income tax rate from 4.55% to 4.5% and expands the state’s nonrefundable Child Tax Credit (CTC) to children under the age of 6 (previously limited to kids 1-4).[^1] SB71 expands the state’s Social Security credit (which offsets any tax liability from Social Security benefits) by increasing the income thresholds at which the credit begins to phase out by 20%. Each change applies for tax year 2025. \n",
    "\n",
    "We at PolicyEngine have updated our model to reflect these changes and analyzed their effects on the state of Utah and its residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key results for 2025:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces state revenues by $96 million\n",
    "* Benefits 62% of Utah residents\n",
    "* Has no effect on the Supplemental Poverty Measure \n",
    "* Lowers the Gini index of inequality by 0.001%\n",

    "[^1]: HB106 also reduces the state’s corporate tax rate to 4.5% and establishes a nonrefundable credit for employer-provided childcare. We did not include these provisions in our analysis.  \n"

    "The reduction in Utah’s income tax rate to 4.5% via HB106 will mark the 4th year in a row in which the flat tax has been cut. In 2021, the state’s income tax rate stood at 4.95% before dropping to 4.85% in 2022, 4.65% in 2023, and 4.55% in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the income tax cut, HB106 has modified the nonrefundable CTC by increasing the number of kids eligible for the credit. In 2025, households can now claim children who are either under the age of 1 or exactly 5 years old. Previously, only children between 1 and 4 qualified. The changes will result in all children below the age of 6 being eligible. The $1,000 credit will offset the tax liability of households with children in the new age range. However, since it is nonrefundable, households with a state tax liability below $1,000 will not receive the entire credit. The credit begins to phase out at 10% starting at $43,000 for single households and $54,000 for married couples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Social Security credit in Utah acts as a nonrefundable credit that offsets any tax liability that is derived from benefits stemming from Social Security. Households must have AGI below certain thresholds for their entire Social Security tax liability to be eliminated. Those above will see their credit phased out by 2.5%. SB71 modified the thresholds as follows: The threshold for single households increases from $45,000 to $54,000, while those who are married but file separately will see their threshold increase from $37,500 to $45,000. All other filing statuses’ Social Security threshold will increase from $75,000 to $90,000. \n"

    "## Household Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are several components to the tax package, different household compositions will see unique impacts to their net income.\n",
    "Most households will benefit solely from the reduction in the state's income tax rate. However, additional benefits apply to two groups: middle-income households with newborns and 5 year old children or families that receive Social Security benefits and have earnings above the old Social Security credit thresholds. For example, a single adult earning $50,000 will see a [$25 reduction in their tax liability](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=ut&timePeriod=2025&baseline=81314&household=52568) solely due to the income tax rate cut. However, a single parent with the same annual income and a child who is 5 years old would [gain $325](https://legacy.policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=ut&timePeriod=2025&baseline=81314&household=52567) as the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit would lower their tax liability by an additional $300. Figure 1 displays the change in net income for this household as earnings rise. \n"

    "Due to the increases in the thresholds, the household will see an increase in its Social Security credit allotment from $51,000 to $110,500 in earnings (excluding Social Security benefits). However, their Social Security credit drops between $19,000 and $50,500, due to their overall tax liability dropping, resulting in the non-refundable credit offsetting less income tax. The maximum increase in the credit that this household composition would gain is $362, if their earnings are between $64,500 and $95,500 (see Figure 3). Table 1 summarizes these households and their change in net income.\n"

# Testing multi-agent AI workflows for policy research

Description: A multi-agent Claude Code system fared better on distributional analysis than benefit interactions; insights inform our forthcoming plugin.

---

When we finished our [UK carbon dividend analysis](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-carbon-tax-dividend) this autumn, we wondered whether [Claude Code's](https://claude.com/claude-code) multi-agent system could have automated parts of the research workflow. We tested it on a similar policy analysis to find out.

## Building a multi-agent research workflow

Using Claude Code, we configured three [specialised agents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/agents) to handle different parts of a policy analysis pipeline. The first agent fetches PolicyEngine microsimulation data from our GitHub repositories and documentation. The second writes analysis scripts using our [Python package](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk). The third generates formatted research output from the results.

We stored each agent as a markdown file in [`.claude/agents/`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/agents#creating-custom-agents), defining their specific roles and tools. The data fetching agent got access to GitHub APIs and PolicyEngine documentation. The script writer could execute Python and access our policyengine-uk package. The report generator worked with markdown formatting and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) visualisations.

![](/images/posts/multi-agent-workflows-policy-research/claude-code-interface.png)

Claude Code automatically routes tasks to the appropriate agent based on the request. When we asked it to analyse a carbon tax scenario, it handled the coordination without explicit instructions about which agent should do what.

![](/images/posts/multi-agent-workflows-policy-research/create-agent-dialog.png)

## What worked

For standard distributional analyses—calculating poverty rates, Gini coefficients, and decile-level impacts—the workflow produced output matching our manual approach. The agents correctly structured PolicyEngine API calls and generated properly formatted charts.

The system saved the most time on repetitive tasks. Once we configured the agents for UK distributional analysis, we needed minimal adjustments to run similar analyses on other policies. This matters for our work where we often model multiple versions of the same reform.

The report generator consistently matched PolicyEngine's house style at least as well as our human writers typically do on first attempt. It maintained active voice, avoided subjective adjectives, and led with quantitative findings.

## What didn't work

Complex policy modelling exposed the limits. When calculations required understanding interactions between multiple benefit programmes—like how Universal Credit's taper interacts with Housing Benefit phase-outs—the agents struggled. They would implement each programme correctly in isolation but miss the coordination logic.

We found prompt precision mattered more than expected. An instruction to "analyse carbon tax impacts" produced generic output. We needed specifics: "Calculate relative change in net income by decile, poverty rates by demographic group, and constituency-level winners and losers." The agents don't infer methodological standards the way human researchers do.

We hit an unexpected problem with code review. Our first approach used the script-writing agent to review its own code. This caught syntax errors but missed logical problems. We had to create a separate reviewer agent with different prompting to get meaningful code critique.

![](/images/posts/multi-agent-workflows-policy-research/agents-in-progress.png)

## What we learned

Multi-agent workflows work best when the task has clear boundaries and established patterns. Our monthly policy briefs analysing government reforms fit this pattern. Research exploring new methodologies doesn't.

The technology changes how we think about research automation. Instead of one AI that does everything, specialised agents with defined responsibilities produce more reliable output. This mirrors how a streamlined policy analysis shop might operate—one person pulls data, another writes Python, a third formats the report.

These limitations reveal where human judgement remains essential. When policy interactions get complex, when methodological choices require expertise, or when political context matters for framing, the agents defer to human researchers. That's the right division of labour.

## Addressing the shortcomings

We're working to address these limitations through improved agent configurations and leveraging Anthropic's recently launched [Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) and [plugin ecosystem](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins). Skills allow us to package specific PolicyEngine expertise—like properly structuring benefit programme interactions or applying our methodological standards—into reusable components that Claude Code loads when needed.

We're packaging these insights into the [policyengine-claude plugin](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-mcp), which enables other researchers to use Claude Code with PolicyEngine more effectively. The plugin includes specialised agents, pre-configured skills for common policy analyses, and direct database access through the Model Context Protocol.

We'll demonstrate this workflow at our [PolicyEngine 2.0 event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/policyengine-20-and-the-future-of-public-policy-analysis-tickets-1673065246189?aff=oddtdtcreator) on 3 November in London, where we'll show how these tools work together for real policy analysis. If you're interested in seeing multi-agent workflows in action for policy research, we'd encourage you to attend.

We're deploying this workflow for routine policy updates where the analysis structure stays constant. It won't replace human researchers, but it will free them to focus on questions that require genuine policy expertise rather than technical execution.
