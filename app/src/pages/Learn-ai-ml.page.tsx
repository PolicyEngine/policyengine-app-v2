      PolicyEngine integrates large language models with our computational tax-benefit engine to
      transform complex calculations into clear explanations.
      <br />
      <br />
      For household calculations, we process thousands of intermediate values across tax and benefit
      programs, then use Anthropic's Claude API to generate plain-language explanations of
      eligibility, amounts, and potential changes.
      <br />
      <br />
      For policy analysis, we leverage GPT-4 to weave narratives from our computational results,
      explaining reforms in terms anyone can understand - from simplified `ELI5` explanations to
      detailed technical analyses for policy experts.
