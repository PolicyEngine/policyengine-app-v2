/**
 * PopulationBrowseModal - Full-featured population browsing and creation modal
 *
 * This modal supports:
 * - Browse mode: Search geographies (nationwide, states, districts)
 * - Creation mode: Create new households with HouseholdBuilderForm
 *
 * TODO: Extract from ReportBuilder.page.tsx and refactor to use:
 * - BrowseModalTemplate for consistent modal layout
 * - CreationStatusHeader for the creation mode status bar
 *
 * The modal is currently defined in ReportBuilder.page.tsx (lines ~3100-4030)
 * and should be moved here with updated imports.
