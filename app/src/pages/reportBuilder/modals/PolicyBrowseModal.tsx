/**
 * PolicyBrowseModal - Full-featured policy browsing and creation modal
 *
 * This modal supports:
 * - Browse mode: Search and select from saved policies
 * - Creation mode: Create new policies with parameter editing
 *
 * TODO: Extract from ReportBuilder.page.tsx and refactor to use:
 * - BrowseModalTemplate for consistent modal layout
 * - CreationStatusHeader for the creation mode status bar
 *
 * The modal is currently defined in ReportBuilder.page.tsx (lines ~1770-3080)
 * and should be moved here with updated imports.
