PolicyEngine has received a $273,500 grant from [Arnold Ventures](https://www.arnoldventures.org/) to develop state and congressional district-level policy analysis capabilities. This funding will enable policymakers to see how tax and benefit reforms affect all 435 congressional districts and 50 states.

## Project goals

The grant supports expanding PolicyEngine's geographic analysis capabilities in three areas:

### Congressional district breakdowns

We will develop the infrastructure to produce policy impact estimates at the congressional district level. This will allow Members of Congress and their staff to understand how proposed legislation affects their specific constituents, including impacts on poverty rates, income distribution, and tax burdens within each of the 435 districts.

### State-level enhancements

Building on our existing nationwide state tax modeling, we will improve state-level impact estimates for federal policy changes. This includes better integration of state tax interactions with federal reforms and more granular demographic breakdowns by state.

### Enhanced microdata

We will improve our underlying microdata to support reliable subnational estimates, including developing new weighting and imputation methods to produce accurate results at smaller geographic levels.
