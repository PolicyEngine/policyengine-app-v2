This Giving Tuesday, we're launching [**GiveCalc**](https://givecalc.org) at [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org). This free, open-source calculator computes how charitable donations affect your federal and state taxes, helping you understand the true cost of giving—to any charity, including [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/us/donate).

## What is GiveCalc?

GiveCalc is a comprehensive tax calculator purpose-built for charitable giving. Unlike typical calculators that use marginal tax rates, GiveCalc runs full microsimulations to account for the interactions between donations, itemized deductions, tax credits, and state tax systems.

The calculator supports 2024, 2025, and 2026 tax years—including HR1's charitable contribution changes and downstream state effects—and handles self-employment income, capital gains, dividends, and interest. We've also added [UK Gift Aid support](/uk/research/uk-giving-tuesday-2025) for calculating tax relief on charitable donations in the UK, including Scottish income tax rates. Tax calculations are [validated against NBER's TAXSIM](/us/research/policyengine-nber-mou-taxsim).

## How it works

GiveCalc uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to compute your taxes with and without donations. Enter your income, filing status, state, and deductions, and GiveCalc shows your net tax impact, the marginal tax savings per additional dollar donated, and the donation required to achieve any target net income reduction.

For example, a single California filer earning $200,000 with $20,000 in mortgage interest saves $5,857 in taxes on a $20,000 donation—a 33% marginal savings rate that makes their net cost $14,143.

## Supporting PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine advances evidence-based policy through open-source economic simulation models. We build epistemic infrastructure that improves institutional decisionmaking by making tax and benefit policy transparent, accessible, and rigorously quantifiable.

[PolicyEngine's calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/reports) lets anyone model how taxes and benefits affect their specific situation—and how proposed reforms would change it. This reduces information asymmetries between policymakers and the public. When major legislation moves through Congress, we build custom tools to help people understand impacts. Our [OBBBA household calculator](https://policyengine.github.io/obbba-household-by-household/) lets anyone see how reconciliation bill provisions affect their family.

Beyond policy understanding, our infrastructure directly increases welfare. Tools like [MyFriendBen](https://myfriendben.org), [Amplifi Benefit Navigator](https://www.benefitnavigator.us), [Starlight](https://www.meetstarlight.com), and [Mirza](https://mirza.co) use PolicyEngine's API to screen families for 40+ federal and state programs they may qualify for. Collectively, these tools have identified over $1 billion in unclaimed benefits—direct welfare gains from reducing administrative barriers.

We're also investigating how public policy mediates the relationship between AI-driven economic transformation and distributional outcomes. Our [research framework](https://policyengine.github.io/ai-growth-research/) examines the causal chain from AI economic shocks—rising productivity, capital share growth, labor disruption—through policy interventions to effects on income, consumption, and wealth inequality. This addresses an underexplored question: as AI potentially drives major economic shifts, how would different policy responses shape who benefits and who loses? We model how current policies versus alternatives (UBI, expanded safety nets, capital taxation) would differentially mediate these changes.

Donations to PolicyEngine are tax-deductible in the US and eligible for Gift Aid in the UK (charity no. 1210532). Contributions support expanding benefit program coverage so screening tools can help more families, improving data accuracy for poverty and distributional analysis, and sustaining free access for researchers, governments, and the public. See how we spend donations on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/policyengine).

[Donate to PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/us/donate) and use [GiveCalc](https://givecalc.org) to calculate your tax savings.

## Try GiveCalc

Visit [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org) to calculate how your charitable giving affects your taxes. Like all PolicyEngine tools, GiveCalc is [fully open source](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/givecalc)—you can inspect the code, verify the calculations, and contribute improvements. We welcome [contributions and feedback](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/givecalc/issues).
