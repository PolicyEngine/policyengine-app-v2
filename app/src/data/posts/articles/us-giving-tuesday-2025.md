This Giving Tuesday, we're launching [**GiveCalc**](https://givecalc.org) as a standalone web application at [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org). The free calculator computes how charitable donations affect your federal and state taxes, helping you understand the true cost of giving—to any charity, including [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/us/donate).

## What's new

Since [launching GiveCalc last year](/us/research/givecalc), we've rebuilt it from the ground up:

- **New domain**: Access GiveCalc directly at [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org)
- **UK Gift Aid support**: Calculate tax relief on charitable donations in the UK, including [Scottish income tax rates](/uk/research/givecalc-uk)
- **React frontend**: Faster, more responsive interface
- **2025 tax year support**: Calculate impacts for 2024, 2025, or 2026, including HR1's charitable contribution changes and downstream state tax effects
- **Expanded income types**: Add self-employment, capital gains, dividends, and interest income
- **Mobile-friendly design**: Use GiveCalc on any device
- **Validated accuracy**: Tax calculations powered by our [partnership with the National Bureau of Economic Research](/us/research/policyengine-nber-mou-taxsim)

## How it works

GiveCalc uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to compute your taxes with and without donations. Enter your income, filing status, state, and deductions, and GiveCalc shows:

1. **Net tax impact**: How much your donation reduces your tax liability
2. **Marginal giving discount**: The tax savings per additional dollar donated
3. **Target donation finder**: The donation required to achieve a specific net income reduction

For example, a single California filer earning $200,000 with $20,000 in mortgage interest saves $5,857 in taxes on a $20,000 donation — a 33% marginal savings rate that makes their net cost $14,143.

## Supporting PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine advances evidence-based policy through open-source economic simulation models. We build epistemic infrastructure that improves institutional decisionmaking by making tax and benefit policy transparent, accessible, and rigorously quantifiable.

### Policy understanding

[PolicyEngine's calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/reports) lets anyone model how taxes and benefits affect their specific situation—and how proposed reforms would change it. This reduces information asymmetries between policymakers and the public.

### High-profile policy analysis

When major legislation moves through Congress, we build custom tools to help the public understand impacts. Our [OBBBA household calculator](https://policyengine.github.io/obbba-household-by-household/) lets anyone see how reconciliation bill provisions affect their family.

### Benefit access

Tools like [MyFriendBen](https://myfriendben.org), [Amplifi Benefit Navigator](https://www.benefitnavigator.us), [Starlight](https://www.meetstarlight.com), and [Mirza](https://mirza.co) use PolicyEngine's API to screen families for 40+ federal and state programs they may qualify for. Collectively, these tools have identified over $1 billion in unclaimed benefits—direct welfare gains from reducing administrative barriers.

### AI and inequality research

We're investigating how public policy mediates the relationship between AI-driven economic transformation and distributional outcomes. Our [research framework](https://policyengine.github.io/ai-growth-research/) examines the causal chain from AI economic shocks (rising productivity, capital share growth, labor disruption) through policy interventions to effects on income, consumption, and wealth inequality.

This addresses an underexplored question: as AI potentially drives major economic shifts—unevenly distributed productivity gains, changing capital-labor shares, technological unemployment—how would different policy responses shape who benefits and who loses? We model how current policies versus alternatives (UBI, expanded safety nets, capital taxation) would differentially mediate these AI-driven changes.

### What donations support

Donations to PolicyEngine are tax-deductible in the US and eligible for Gift Aid in the UK (charity no. 1210532). Donations support:

- **More programs**: Expanding benefit coverage so screening tools can help more families
- **Better data**: Improving accuracy for poverty and distributional analysis
- **Open infrastructure**: Sustaining free access for researchers, governments, and the public

See how we spend donations on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/policyengine).

[Donate to PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/us/donate) and use [GiveCalc](https://givecalc.org) to calculate your tax savings.
