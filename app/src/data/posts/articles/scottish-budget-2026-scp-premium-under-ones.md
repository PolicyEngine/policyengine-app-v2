In December 2024, Finance Secretary Shona Robison [announced](https://news.stv.tv/politics/families-with-babies-to-get-40-a-week-scottish-government-announces) a new Scottish Child Payment (SCP) Premium for under-ones, increasing the payment to £40 per week for families with a baby under the age of one. This premium represents a 47% increase over the standard SCP payment of £27.15 per week.

The Scottish Child Payment is a weekly payment to low-income families in Scotland for each child under 16. The SCP Premium for under-ones increases this payment from £27.15 to £40 per week during a child's first year of life.

Using PolicyEngine's Scotland tax-benefit microsimulation model, we estimate that this reform would cost approximately £14 million in 2026-27, rising to £16 million by 2030-31. All gains are concentrated in the bottom four income deciles, with the largest benefits going to the second decile.

## Background: The Scottish Child Payment

The Scottish Child Payment is a Scottish Government benefit paid to eligible low-income families for each child under 16. The payment is currently £27.15 per week (£1,412 per year) per eligible child. Eligibility requires the family to receive certain qualifying benefits, including Universal Credit, Child Tax Credit, Income Support, Pension Credit, or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.

The new premium of £40 per week (£2,080 per year) will apply only to children under the age of one, providing an additional £668 per year during a child's first year of life.

## Budgetary impact

PolicyEngine estimates the following costs for the premium over the forecast period.

**Table 1: Estimated cost of the SCP Premium for under-ones**

| Year    | Cost (£ million) |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 2026-27 | 14.2             |
| 2027-28 | 14.9             |
| 2028-29 | 16.2             |
| 2029-30 | 16.3             |
| 2030-31 | 16.3             |

## Distributional impact

We find that the new program is limited to households in the bottom four income deciles. Figure 1 shows the absolute change in household income (in £ per year) by income decile.

In 2026-27, the second decile sees the largest gain at £2.84 per year. The first decile gains £2.54 per year, the third decile £1.71 per year, and the fourth decile £0.70 per year. Deciles 5-10 see no gains.

Figure 2 shows the relative change in household income by decile, with a year selector to see how the impact evolves from 2026-27 to 2030-31.

## Poverty impact

We measure poverty using absolute poverty before housing costs, defined as households with income below 60% of the 2010/11 median income, adjusted for inflation. This is the standard definition used in the government's [Households Below Average Income](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2) publication.

In 2026-27, overall poverty falls by 0.048 percentage points and child poverty by 0.12 percentage points. These figures remain roughly stable through 2029-30. Approximately 6,000 families would receive the premium.

## Constituency impact

## Conclusion

The SCP Premium for under-ones would cost approximately £14 million in 2026-27, rising to £16 million by 2030-31, and provide an additional £668 annually to eligible families during their child's first year of life. All benefits flow to the bottom four income deciles, with the second decile seeing the largest gains.
