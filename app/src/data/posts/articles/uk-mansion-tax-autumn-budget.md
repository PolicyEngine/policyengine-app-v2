## Introduction

The UK Autumn Budget has reignited discussions around wealth taxation, with a mansion tax on high-value properties being one option under consideration. Such a tax would apply an annual charge to properties valued above a certain threshold, typically £1.5 million or £2 million.

In this analysis, we examine which UK parliamentary constituencies would be most affected by a mansion tax, using Land Registry property sales data to estimate the geographic distribution of high-value properties across the country.

## Methodology

We analysed Land Registry price paid data to identify property sales that would exceed £1.5 million and £2 million thresholds in 2026-27. To project 2024 transaction prices to 2026-27 values, we applied the OBR house price index forecast from the [October 2024 Economic and Fiscal Outlook](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/).

**Uprating approach:**
- 2024 HPI: 148.74
- 2026-27 HPI forecast: 154.03
- Uprating factor: 1.0355 (+3.55%)

For each constituency, we calculated:

- The number of properties that would exceed each threshold (after uprating)
- The percentage of households that would be affected
- Estimated annual revenue based on a £2,000 annual charge per property

Property sales data serves as a proxy for the stock of high-value properties, as properties that transact above these thresholds likely indicate households that would be subject to a mansion tax.

## Results: £1.5 million threshold

Under a £1.5 million threshold, we estimate approximately 15,300 properties would be affected across the UK in 2026-27, generating an estimated £30.6 million in annual revenue.

The impact is heavily concentrated in London and the South East. The constituencies with the highest proportion of households affected are:

| Constituency | % Households affected | Properties |
|:-------------|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Cities of London and Westminster | 1.67% | 990 |
| Kensington and Bayswater | 1.25% | 783 |
| Chelsea and Fulham | 1.17% | 637 |
| Hampstead and Highgate | 0.77% | 406 |
| Battersea | 0.76% | 362 |
| Richmond Park | 0.66% | 301 |
| Islington South and Finsbury | 0.53% | 277 |
| Hammersmith and Chiswick | 0.50% | 260 |
| Holborn and St Pancras | 0.48% | 219 |
| Runnymede and Weybridge | 0.42% | 184 |

## Results: £2 million threshold

Raising the threshold to £2 million reduces the number of affected properties to approximately 8,500 in 2026-27, with estimated annual revenue of £17.0 million.

The geographic concentration becomes even more pronounced at the higher threshold:

| Constituency | % Households affected | Properties |
|:-------------|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Cities of London and Westminster | 1.32% | 782 |
| Kensington and Bayswater | 0.93% | 583 |
| Chelsea and Fulham | 0.74% | 401 |
| Hampstead and Highgate | 0.46% | 242 |
| Richmond Park | 0.34% | 153 |
| Holborn and St Pancras | 0.32% | 147 |
| Battersea | 0.30% | 144 |
| Islington South and Finsbury | 0.28% | 146 |
| Hammersmith and Chiswick | 0.24% | 127 |
| Runnymede and Weybridge | 0.24% | 103 |

## Geographic distribution

The maps reveal a striking geographic pattern. At both thresholds:

- **London dominates**: The vast majority of affected properties are in London constituencies, particularly in central and west London
- **South East clusters**: Outside London, constituencies in Surrey, Berkshire, and other Home Counties show elevated levels
- **Limited impact elsewhere**: Most constituencies outside the South East would see minimal or zero impact from a mansion tax

This concentration means a mansion tax would primarily affect voters in a small number of constituencies, raising questions about its political feasibility and regional equity implications.

## Limitations

This analysis has several limitations:

1. **Sales vs. stock**: We use property sales as a proxy for the stock of high-value properties. The actual number of properties above each threshold may differ.
2. **National uprating**: We apply the national OBR house price index uniformly. Regional price growth may vary, particularly between London and other areas.
3. **Threshold effects**: Properties just below thresholds might be revalued above them, or owners might contest valuations.

## Conclusion

A mansion tax would have a highly concentrated geographic impact, primarily affecting constituencies in London and the South East. Under a £1.5 million threshold, approximately 15,300 properties would be affected in 2026-27, falling to 8,500 under a £2 million threshold. The Cities of London and Westminster constituency would be most affected under both scenarios, with over 1% of households subject to the tax.
