## Introduction

The Treasury is [reportedly considering](https://www.baggette.co.uk/accumulation/mansion-tax-uk-2025-what-homeowners-need-to-know/) a mansion tax for the [Autumn Budget 2025](https://cms-lawnow.com/en/ealerts/2025/11/autumn-budget-2025-expectations-and-speculation-regarding-tax-measures). The proposed tax would charge around 1% annually on property values above £2 million.

This analysis estimates which UK parliamentary constituencies would be most affected by a mansion tax.

## Methodology

We use Land Registry price paid data to identify property sales above £1.5 million and £2 million thresholds. We uprate 2024 transaction prices to 2026-27 values using the OBR house price index forecast from the [October 2024 Economic and Fiscal Outlook](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/).

| Parameter | Value |
|:----------|:------|
| 2024 HPI | 148.74 |
| 2026-27 HPI forecast | 154.03 |
| Uprating factor | 1.0355 (+3.55%) |

For each constituency, we calculate the number of properties exceeding each threshold after uprating, the percentage of households affected, and estimated annual revenue assuming a £2,000 annual charge per property.

## £1.5 million threshold

Under a £1.5 million threshold, 15,300 properties would be affected in 2026-27, generating £30.6 million in annual revenue.

| Constituency | % Households affected | Properties |
|:-------------|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Cities of London and Westminster | 1.67% | 990 |
| Kensington and Bayswater | 1.25% | 783 |
| Chelsea and Fulham | 1.17% | 637 |
| Hampstead and Highgate | 0.77% | 406 |
| Battersea | 0.76% | 362 |
| Richmond Park | 0.66% | 301 |
| Islington South and Finsbury | 0.53% | 277 |
| Hammersmith and Chiswick | 0.50% | 260 |
| Holborn and St Pancras | 0.48% | 219 |
| Runnymede and Weybridge | 0.42% | 184 |

## £2 million threshold

Under a £2 million threshold, 8,500 properties would be affected in 2026-27, generating £17.0 million in annual revenue.

| Constituency | % Households affected | Properties |
|:-------------|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Cities of London and Westminster | 1.32% | 782 |
| Kensington and Bayswater | 0.93% | 583 |
| Chelsea and Fulham | 0.74% | 401 |
| Hampstead and Highgate | 0.46% | 242 |
| Richmond Park | 0.34% | 153 |
| Holborn and St Pancras | 0.32% | 147 |
| Battersea | 0.30% | 144 |
| Islington South and Finsbury | 0.28% | 146 |
| Hammersmith and Chiswick | 0.24% | 127 |
| Runnymede and Weybridge | 0.24% | 103 |

## Geographic distribution

The impact is concentrated in London and the South East. Most constituencies outside these areas would see minimal impact.

## Limitations

1. We use property sales as a proxy for the stock of high-value properties.
2. We apply the national OBR house price index uniformly; regional price growth may vary.
3. Properties near thresholds may be revalued or contested.

## Conclusion

A mansion tax would primarily affect constituencies in London and the South East. Under a £1.5 million threshold, 15,300 properties would be affected in 2026-27, falling to 8,500 under a £2 million threshold. Cities of London and Westminster would be most affected under both scenarios.
