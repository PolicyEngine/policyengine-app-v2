A bipartisan group of senators has introduced the [Bipartisan Health Insurance Affordability Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/976) (S. 976), which would extend and modify Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. In this report, we use the PolicyEngine ACA microsimulation model to analyze how this bill would affect representative households compared to current law and a full IRA extension.

## Background

The enhanced ACA premium tax credits enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act are set to expire at the end of 2025. The Bipartisan Health Insurance Affordability Act proposes an alternative approach that extends eligibility to 700% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) with a modified contribution schedule.

**Table 1: Required contribution percentage schedule under the Bipartisan Health Insurance Affordability Act**

| Income Range (% FPL) | Initial Premium % | Final Premium % |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 200% up to 250%     | 2.0%              | 4.0%            |
| 250% up to 300%     | 4.0%              | 6.0%            |
| 300% up to 400%     | 6.0%              | 8.5%            |
| 400% up to 600%     | 8.5%              | 8.5%            |
| 600% up to 700%     | 8.5%              | 9.25%           |

We compare three scenarios:

1. **Baseline (2026 law)**: Current law after IRA enhancements expire, with eligibility ending at 400% FPL.
2. **700% FPL Extension**: The proposed bill extending eligibility to 700% FPL with the amended contribution schedule.
3. **IRA Extension**: Extending the current enhanced subsidies indefinitely, with an 8.5% cap and no income limit above 400% FPL.

## Example 1: Family of four in Tampa, Florida

Consider a family of four in Hillsborough County, Florida with two parents aged 40 and two children aged 10 and 8.

**Table 2: Premium tax credits for Florida household at select income levels**

| Income Level | Income | Baseline PTC | 700% FPL Extension PTC | IRA Extension PTC |
|--------------|--------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 300% FPL | $96,450 | $9,173 | $12,993 | $12,993 |
| 400% FPL | $128,600 | $0 | $7,849 | $7,849 |
| 600% FPL | $192,900 | $0 | $1,100 | $2,383 |
| 700% FPL | $225,050 | $0 | $0 | $1,200 |

At 400% FPL, the household receives no premium tax credit under current law but would receive approximately $7,849 under either the 700% FPL extension or IRA extension. At 600% FPL, the 700% FPL extension provides $1,100 while the IRA extension provides $2,383. The 700% FPL extension ends eligibility at 700% FPL, while the IRA extension continues providing credits above this threshold.

## Example 2: Couple in San Benito County, California

Consider a couple in San Benito County, California—one person aged 64 and another aged 62. This household faces higher benchmark premiums due to age-based rating in ACA marketplaces.

**Table 3: Premium tax credits for California household at select income levels**

| Income Level | Income | Baseline PTC | 700% FPL Extension PTC | IRA Extension PTC |
|--------------|--------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 300% FPL | $64,994 | $36,242 | $38,634 | $38,702 |
| 400% FPL | $86,658 | $0 | $33,737 | $35,349 |
| 600% FPL | $129,987 | $0 | $26,000 | $30,500 |

At 400% FPL, the household receives no premium tax credit under current law but would receive approximately $33,737 under the 700% FPL extension or $35,349 under the IRA extension.

## Conclusion

The Bipartisan Health Insurance Affordability Act would extend premium tax credit eligibility from 400% FPL to 700% FPL while implementing a modified contribution schedule. Compared to current law after IRA expiration, households between 400% and 700% FPL would receive premium tax credits they would not otherwise receive. Compared to a full IRA extension, the bill provides similar benefits up to 400% FPL, with differences emerging at higher income levels due to the 9.25% contribution cap at 700% FPL versus the IRA's 8.5% cap with no upper limit.
