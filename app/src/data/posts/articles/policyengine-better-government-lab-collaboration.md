PolicyEngine is partnering with the [Better Government Lab](https://fordschool.umich.edu/bgl) to support research on government benefit programs and their effects on American households.

Understanding how safety net programs interact is essential for evidence-based policymaking. Program rules for SNAP, TANF, SSI, and state tax credits vary significantly across states and have changed over time—making comprehensive analysis challenging without specialized modeling tools.

## Scope of the partnership

Our team is consulting on how to model historical program rules for tax years 2018 and 2023, helping the Lab analyze how safety net programs have evolved over time. We're also assisting with integration of PolicyEngine code into their analysis pipeline and training research assistants on policy parameter updates.

The collaboration focuses on programs where state-level policy choices substantially affect household eligibility and benefit amounts—including SNAP, TANF, SSI, and state tax credits.

## Building in public

All code written under this engagement will be published to our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) under the AGPL-3.0 license. Every improvement we make for this project benefits the broader research community.

Researchers can use our [web calculator](https://policyengine.org/us) to explore how these programs affect hypothetical households, or download the Python package to run custom analyses.

We're proud to support research that helps policymakers understand how government programs work in practice.
