Finance Secretary Shona Robison [announced today](https://news.stv.tv/politics/families-with-babies-to-get-40-a-week-scottish-government-announces) that the Scottish Child Payment will be boosted to £40 per week for families with a baby under the age of one. This new "baby boost" rate represents a 47% increase over the current payment of £27.15 per week, delivering what Robison described as the "strongest package of support for families with young children anywhere in the UK."

Using PolicyEngine's Scotland tax-benefit microsimulation model, we estimate that this reform would cost approximately £80 million in 2026-27, rising to £83 million by 2030-31. Around 0.12% of the Scottish population would benefit, with all gains concentrated in the bottom four income deciles.

## Background: The Scottish Child Payment

The Scottish Child Payment is a Scottish Government benefit paid to eligible low-income families for each child under 16. The payment is currently £27.15 per week (£1,412 per year) per eligible child. Eligibility requires the family to receive certain qualifying benefits, including Universal Credit, Child Tax Credit, Income Support, Pension Credit, or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.

The new baby boost rate of £40 per week (£2,080 per year) will apply only to children under the age of one, providing an additional £668 per year during a child's first year of life.

## Budgetary impact

PolicyEngine estimates the following costs for the baby boost over the forecast period.

**Table 1: Estimated cost of the Scottish Child Payment baby boost**

| Year    | Cost (£ million) |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 2026-27 | 79.9             |
| 2027-28 | 74.9             |
| 2028-29 | 78.6             |
| 2029-30 | 79.2             |
| 2030-31 | 83.5             |

## Distributional impact

Benefits are concentrated in the bottom four income deciles. Figure 1 shows the relative change in household income by decile, with a year selector to see how the impact evolves from 2026-27 to 2030-31.

In 2026-27, the first decile sees the largest relative gain at 1.38%, followed by the second decile at 0.96%. Deciles 5-10 see no gains.

Figure 2 shows the absolute change in household income (in £ per year) by income decile.

## Poverty impact

We measure poverty using absolute poverty before housing costs, defined as households with income below 60% of the 2010/11 median income, adjusted for inflation. This is the standard definition used in the government's Households Below Average Income publication.

In 2026-27, overall poverty falls by 0.004 percentage points and child poverty by 0.010 percentage points. These figures remain roughly stable through 2030-31. Approximately 6,000 families would receive the baby boost.

## Constituency impact

In 2026-27, Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey sees the largest average gain at £8.16, followed by East Kilbride and Strathaven at £8.06. Glasgow North has the smallest average gain at £6.87.

## Conclusion

The Scottish Child Payment baby boost would cost approximately £80 million per year and provide an additional £668 annually to eligible families during their child's first year of life. All benefits flow to the bottom four income deciles, affecting around 6,000 families.
