The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) released its [November 2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) alongside the Autumn Budget. This forecast updates the March 2025 projections with significant revisions to inflation and earnings growth.

PolicyEngine uses these OBR projections to uprate monetary values across our UK tax-benefit model, affecting calculations for benefits, tax thresholds, and policy impacts.

## Key changes

The November 2025 forecast shows:

- **Higher CPI inflation in 2025**: Revised up from 3.2% to 3.5%, reflecting higher energy prices and the new employer National Insurance increases
- **Higher earnings growth through 2026**: Revised up significantly, with 2025 now at 5.2% vs 3.7% previously
- **Higher RPI through 2027**: Reflecting the CPI revisions and housing cost pressures

## Implications for PolicyEngine

These updated projections affect several PolicyEngine calculations:

1. **Benefit uprating**: Most working-age benefits are uprated by CPI. The higher 2025-26 CPI forecasts mean larger benefit increases in April 2026.

2. **Tax threshold freezes**: The higher inflation forecasts increase the real cost of frozen income tax thresholds, as more income gets pushed into higher tax bands.

3. **Earnings projections**: Our household simulations use earnings growth to project future incomes, affecting multi-year policy impact estimates.

4. **Real terms analysis**: When presenting results in real terms, we deflate using these CPI projections.
