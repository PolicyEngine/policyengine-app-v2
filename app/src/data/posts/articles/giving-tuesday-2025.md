This Giving Tuesday, we're launching [**GiveCalc**](https://givecalc.org) as a standalone web application at [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org). The free calculator computes how charitable donations affect your federal and state taxes, helping you understand the true cost of giving.

## What's new

Since [launching GiveCalc last year](/us/research/givecalc), we've rebuilt it from the ground up:

- **New domain**: Access GiveCalc directly at [givecalc.org](https://givecalc.org)
- **React frontend**: Faster, more responsive interface
- **2025 tax year support**: Calculate impacts for 2024, 2025, or 2026
- **Expanded income types**: Add self-employment, capital gains, dividends, and interest income
- **Mobile-friendly design**: Use GiveCalc on any device

## How it works

GiveCalc uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to compute your taxes with and without donations. Enter your income, filing status, state, and deductions, and GiveCalc shows:

1. **Net tax impact**: How much your donation reduces your tax liability
2. **Marginal giving discount**: The tax savings per additional dollar donated
3. **Target donation finder**: The donation required to achieve a specific net income reduction

For example, a single California filer earning $200,000 with $20,000 in mortgage interest saves $5,818 in taxes on a $19,900 donation — a 33% marginal savings rate that makes their net cost $14,082.

## Supporting PolicyEngine

GiveCalc demonstrates what PolicyEngine does: we build open-source tools that help people understand tax and benefit policy. Our work includes:

- **[PolicyEngine US](https://policyengine.org/us)**: Free tax-benefit calculator covering federal taxes, all 50 states, and dozens of benefit programs
- **[PolicyEngine UK](https://policyengine.org/uk)**: Working with top levels of central government to improve evidence-based policy
- **[Policy analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research)**: Research on proposals from federal reconciliation bills to state tax reforms
- **Benefit access**: Powering tools like [MyFriendBen](https://myfriendben.org) that help families discover benefits they qualify for

Donations to PolicyEngine are tax-deductible in the US and support:

- Expanding coverage of tax credits and benefit programs
- Improving data quality through enhanced microdata
- Building new tools like GiveCalc
- Maintaining free, open-source access for everyone

[Donate to PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/us/donate) and use [GiveCalc](https://givecalc.org) to calculate your tax savings.
