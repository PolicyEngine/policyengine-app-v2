On January 13th, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee in his State of his Stae address proposed a Child Tax Credit as part of his fiscal year 2027 budget. The $325 fully refundable credit would replace state's personal exemption for children under the age of 19.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change on Rhode Island and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

- Costs the state $35.2 million
- Benefits 36.5% of Rhode Island residents
- Reduces child poverty by 4.2%

## Background

Rhode Island currently provides a personal exemption ($5,100 in 2025) for all household members. The exemption reduce the household's taxable income, providing tax savings. This exemption provides a higher benefit to higher-income families as their income places them in a higher tax bracket. Lower-income families often cannot fully benefit from the exemption and those without taxable income recieve no benefit.

Governor McKee's proposal would replace this exemption with a $325 fully refundable child tax credit. Key features include:

- **Credit amount:** $325 per qualifying child
- **Age eligibility:** Children under 19 years old
- **Refundability:** Fully refundable, meaning families can receive the credit even with no earnings
- **Phase-out:** Begins at $261,000 for all filing statuses, credit is fully phased out once AGI reaches [X]
- **Exemption integration:** Eliminates the personal exemption for dependent children under 19

## Household impacts

The reform primarily benefits lower-income families with children. A married couple with two children would see their net income change as shown in Figure 1.

Lower-income households gain the most because the $325 credit is fully refundable, while the eliminated personal exemption provided less value to families with lower tax liability. Higher-income households near the phase-out threshold may see smaller gains or even small losses if they previously benefited more from the personal exemption.

## Statewide impacts

For tax year 2026, the proposal would reduce state revenues by $35.2 million, according to PolicyEngine's static modeling. The net fiscal cost is approximately $35.2 million, as the elimination of the dependent exemption offsets a significant portion of the credit's cost. The standalone credit would cost approximately $60 million, but eliminating the dependent personal exemption saves roughly $25 million.

The reform would raise the net income of 36.5% of Rhode Island families, with beneficiaries concentrated in lower income deciles. Figure 2 shows the share of residents in each income decile that would gain or lose from the reform.

Average benefits are largest for lower-income households due to the credit's refundability.

We project that the proposal would reduce child poverty by 4.2% as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure.

## Conclusion

Governor McKee's proposed child tax credit would shift Rhode Island's approach to supporting families with children from an income exemption to a refundable credit. This change would direct more benefits to lower-income families while reducing support for higher-income households.
