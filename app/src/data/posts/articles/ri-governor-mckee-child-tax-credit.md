On January 13th, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee in his State of the State address proposed a Child Tax Credit (CTC) as part of his fiscal year 2027 budget. The fully refundable credit would replace the state's personal exemption for children under the age of 19.

We at PolicyEngine, in partnership with the Niskanen Center, constructed a Rhode Island CTC Calculator to analyze the impact of potential Child Tax Credit reforms, including Governor McKee's proposal. This tool was used by the Governor's office to examine different reform options before adopting the final proposal.

- Benefits 29.2% of Rhode Island residents
- Reduces child poverty by 2.1%

## Background

Rhode Island currently provides a personal exemption ($5,100 in 2025) for all household members. The exemption reduces the household's taxable income, providing tax savingswhich rises as household's move up the state's tax brackets. For example, families with income in the higherest tax bracket, can receive a maximum benefit of $305 per exemption ($5,100 x 5.99% = $305). Lower-income families often cannot fully benefit from the exemption, and those with taxable income below the state's standard deduction receive no benefit.

Governor McKee's proposal would replace this exemption with a $325 fully refundable child tax credit. Key features include:

- **Credit amount:** $325 per qualifying child
- **Age eligibility:** Children under 19 years old
- **Refundability:** Fully refundable, meaning families can receive the credit with no earnings
- **Phase-out:** Mirrors the personal exemption's phase-out structure. The credit amount reduces by 20% for each $7,590 of AGI above $265,965 in 2027. 
- **Exemption integration:** Eliminates the personal exemption for CTC-qualifying children; the exemption remains for dependents 19 and older. 

Every household with a child would receive the same credit amount of $325 before the phaseout, rather than their tax savings detemined by their income.

## Household impacts

The reform primarily benefits lower-income families with children, as they see little or no benefit from the personal exemption. For example, a single parent with one child and $20,000 of AGI would see their net income increase by $325, the full credit amount. However, as AGI rises, the change in net income falls as the credit amount is partially offset by the elimination of the perosnal exemption for CTC eligible children. Once a single parent reaches the top income bracket, their change in net income is $7.[^1]

[^1]: We project in 2027, that the maximum tax savinsg that can be attined from the personal exemption is $318 per person. Replacing the exemption with the $325 credit, results in a gain of $7 in net income per child for those in the top income tax bracket.

Lower-income households gain the most because the $325 credit is fully refundable, while the eliminated personal exemption provided less value to families with lower tax liability. Higher-income households near the phase-out threshold see smaller gains as the elimination of the exemption lowers gains from the new CTC.

## Statewide impacts

For tax year 2027, the proposal would reduce state revenues by $36.7 million, according to PolicyEngine's static modeling. 

The reform would raise the net income of 29.2% of Rhode Island families, with beneficiaries concentrated in lower income deciles.

We project that the proposal would reduce child poverty by 2.1% as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure.

## Conclusion

Governor McKee's proposed child tax credit would shift Rhode Island's approach to supporting families with children from an income exemption to a refundable credit. This change would direct more benefits to lower-income families while reducing support for higher-income households.
