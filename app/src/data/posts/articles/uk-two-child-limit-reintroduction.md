Robert Jenrick, Reform UK's economy spokesperson, [announced](https://www.lbc.co.uk/article/reform-restore-two-child-benefit-cap-jenrick-5HjdSWh_2/) on 18 February 2026 that Reform UK would restore the two-child benefit cap. The cap, originally introduced in 2017, prevents parents from claiming Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit child elements for more than two children born after April 2017. Chancellor Rachel Reeves removed the cap from April 2026 as part of the [Autumn Budget 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-autumn-budget-2025).

In this analysis, we [examine](https://gist.github.com/vahid-ahmadi/e1910e3120bbae130584dfcf221ec461) the impact of restoring the two-child limit on government spending, income distribution, poverty rates, income inequality, and geographic variation across parliamentary constituencies.

## Budgetary impact

PolicyEngine [estimates](https://gist.github.com/vahid-ahmadi/e1910e3120bbae130584dfcf221ec461) that restoring the two-child limit would save the government £3.9 billion in 2029-30 and £4.1 billion in 2030-31.

**Table 1: Budgetary impact**

| Year    | Government savings |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2029-30 | £3.9bn             |
| 2030-31 | £4.1bn             |

## Affected households and children

The reform would affect 713 thousand households and 2.5 million children (16.9% of all children) in 2029-30.

**Table 2: Affected households and children**

| Year    | Affected households | Affected children | Share of all children (%) |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 2029-30 | 713k                | 2.5m              | 16.9%                 |
| 2030-31 | 729k                | 2.5m              | 17.2%                 |

## Distributional impact

By income decile, restoring the two-child limit would cause the largest income losses for the second decile. In relative terms, the second decile loses 1.38% of household income in 2029-30. In absolute terms, this amounts to £470 per year. Figure 1 shows both relative and absolute changes by decile, with a toggle to switch between views and year buttons to compare 2029-30 and 2030-31.

The losses decline for higher deciles, with deciles 8 to 10 seeing no change. By 2030-31, the second decile's loss increases to £482 per year.

## Poverty impact

Restoring the two-child limit would increase absolute poverty rates, with the largest effect on children. We measure poverty both before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC).

**Table 3: Change in absolute child poverty rates**

| Year    | Measure | Baseline | Reform | Change (pp) |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 2029-30 | BHC     | 12.79%   | 15.13% | +2.35       |
| 2029-30 | AHC     | 22.30%   | 25.06% | +2.76       |
| 2030-31 | BHC     | 12.92%   | 15.13% | +2.21       |
| 2030-31 | AHC     | 22.34%   | 26.55% | +4.21       |

**Table 4: Change in absolute poverty rates (all people)**

| Year    | Measure | Baseline | Reform | Change (pp) |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 2029-30 | BHC     | 8.86%    | 9.52%  | +0.66       |
| 2029-30 | AHC     | 13.86%   | 14.71% | +0.85       |
| 2030-31 | BHC     | 9.01%    | 9.67%  | +0.66       |
| 2030-31 | AHC     | 13.97%   | 15.26% | +1.28       |

In 2029-30, absolute child poverty (BHC) would increase by 2.35 percentage points, from 12.79% to 15.13%. After housing costs, child poverty would increase by 2.76 percentage points, from 22.30% to 25.06%. By 2030-31, the after housing costs child poverty increase grows to 4.21 percentage points.

## Inequality impact

Restoring the two-child limit would increase income inequality. The Gini index would rise by 0.80% in 2029-30 and 0.81% in 2030-31.

**Table 5: Change in Gini index**

| Year    | Change |
| ------- | ------ |
| 2029-30 | +0.80% |
| 2030-31 | +0.81% |

## Constituency impact

The impact of restoring the two-child limit varies across parliamentary constituencies, as shown in Figure 2.

**Figure 2: Average income change by parliamentary constituency**

The constituencies experiencing the largest average income losses include Bradford East (£333), Birmingham Ladywood (£317), Bradford West (£316), Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North (£293), and Nottingham South (£280).

## Conclusion

PolicyEngine estimates that restoring the two-child benefit cap would save the government £3.9 billion in 2029-30, affecting 713 thousand households and 2.5 million children (16.9% of all children). Absolute child poverty (BHC) would increase by 2.35 percentage points, from 12.79% to 15.13%, and the Gini index would rise by 0.80%. The reform would reduce incomes for the lowest five income deciles, with the second decile losing 1.38% of household income on average. Bradford East, Birmingham Ladywood, and Bradford West would be the most affected constituencies.
