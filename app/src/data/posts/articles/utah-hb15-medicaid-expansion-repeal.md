Utah's [House Bill 15](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/HB0015.html) would repeal the state's Medicaid expansion if federal matching (FMAP) drops below 85%. Currently, the federal government pays 90% of expansion Medicaid costs. This analysis models the scenario where the trigger condition is met and expansion is repealed.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change on Utah residents.

Key results for 2027:

- ~117,000 people would lose Medicaid enrollment
- ~90,500 (77%) would fall into the "coverage gap" (not eligible for ACA subsidies)
- ~26,700 (23%) would gain ACA Premium Tax Credit eligibility
- Utah would save ~$99 million/year
- Federal government would save ~$729 million/year (net of increased ACA costs)

## Understanding the coverage gap

The "coverage gap" refers to people who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too little to qualify for ACA marketplace subsidies. ACA subsidies only begin at 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), while Medicaid expansion covers adults up to 138% FPL. If expansion is repealed, those below 100% FPL would no longer qualify for either program.

## Single adult household

Consider a single adult in Utah. Under current law, adults earning up to 138% FPL (~$22,500/year) qualify for Medicaid expansion, receiving approximately $8,000 in annual benefits.

At $12,000/year (75% FPL), this adult currently receives Medicaid coverage. Under HB 15, they would lose this coverage and fall into the coverage gap—earning too little for ACA subsidies but no longer qualifying for Medicaid.

At $18,000/year (110% FPL), that same adult could transition to ACA coverage, receiving premium tax credits.

**Table 1: Health Benefits for Single Adult in Utah (2027)**

| Income | % FPL | Medicaid (Baseline) | Medicaid (Reform) | ACA PTC (Baseline) | ACA PTC (Reform) | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| $12,000 | 75% | $8,000 | $0 | $0 | $0 | Coverage gap |
| $16,334 | 100% | $8,000 | $0 | $0 | $11,579 | FPL threshold |
| $18,000 | 110% | $8,000 | $0 | $0 | $11,544 | ACA eligible |
| $22,541 | 138% | $8,000 | $0 | $0 | $11,103 | Expansion limit |
| $25,000 | 153% | $0 | $0 | $10,802 | $10,802 | Above expansion |

The chart below shows how health benefits change across income levels for a single adult. Solid lines represent current law, while dotted lines show the reform scenario.

## Single parent with child

For a single parent with one child, the FPL threshold is higher (~$22,100 for a family of two), meaning the coverage gap extends to higher income levels.

A parent earning $15,000/year (68% FPL for a family of two) would fall into the coverage gap under HB 15. The parent would no longer receive ~$8,000 in annual Medicaid benefits and would not qualify for ACA subsidies at this income level. Their child remains covered through Medicaid at lower incomes, transitioning to CHIP at higher incomes—children's eligibility is unaffected by the adult expansion repeal.

At higher incomes (above 100% FPL for their family size), parents can transition to ACA subsidies. Children remain on Medicaid up to ~136% FPL, then CHIP up to 205% FPL (~$46,000 for a family of two), after which they lose coverage.

**Table 2: Health Benefits for Single Parent + Child in Utah (2027)**

| Income | % FPL | Parent Medicaid (Baseline) | Parent Medicaid (Reform) | Child Medicaid/CHIP | ACA PTC (Baseline) | ACA PTC (Reform) | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| $15,000 | 68% | $8,000 | $0 | $3,495 | $0 | $0 | Coverage gap for parent |
| $22,138 | 100% | $8,000 | $0 | $3,495 | $0 | $11,457 | FPL threshold |
| $25,000 | 113% | $8,000 | $0 | $3,495 | $0 | $11,397 | ACA eligible |
| $30,550 | 138% | $8,000 | $0 | $3,495 | $0 | $10,812 | Expansion limit |
| $35,000 | 158% | $0 | $0 | $2,827 | $10,270 | $10,270 | Above expansion (CHIP) |

The chart below shows how health benefits change across income levels for a single parent with one child. The child transitions from Medicaid ($3,495) to CHIP ($2,827) at higher incomes, losing coverage entirely above 205% FPL (~$46,000).

## Statewide fiscal impact

For tax year 2027, HB 15 would generate the following fiscal impacts:

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Total Medicaid savings | $988 million |
| Federal share (90%) | $889 million |
| State share (10%) | $99 million |
| Increased ACA costs (federal) | $160 million |
| **Net federal savings** | **$729 million** |
| **Net state savings** | **$99 million** |

## Who is affected?

Of the ~117,000 people losing Medicaid enrollment:

- **77% fall into the coverage gap**: These individuals earn below 100% FPL and would not qualify for ACA subsidies.

- **23% can transition to ACA**: These individuals earn between 100-138% FPL and can obtain marketplace coverage with premium subsidies.

Children are largely unaffected—they remain eligible for Medicaid/CHIP regardless of the expansion repeal. Only adult coverage under the expansion category is affected.

## Conclusion

Utah HB 15 creates a contingent repeal of Medicaid expansion that would take effect if federal matching drops below 85%. If triggered, the policy would reduce state Medicaid spending by ~$99 million annually. Approximately 90,500 adults earning below 100% FPL would lose coverage and would not qualify for ACA subsidies, while ~26,700 adults at 100-138% FPL could transition to ACA marketplace plans.
