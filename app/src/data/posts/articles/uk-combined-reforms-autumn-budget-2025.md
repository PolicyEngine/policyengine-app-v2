In the [November 2025 Autumn Budget](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/budget-2025), Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a comprehensive package of tax and benefit reforms. This analysis examines the combined economic impacts of these measures using PolicyEngine's microsimulation model. For our analysis of the [OBR's November 2025 economic projections](/uk/research/obr-november-2025-projections), see our separate report.

## Introduction

The Autumn Budget 2025 includes nine key reforms that we model in this analysis. Some measures increase household incomes (such as repealing the two-child limit and freezing fuel duty), while others reduce incomes through higher taxes (such as increased rates on dividends, savings, and property income). This combined analysis captures how these policies interact and their net effect on UK households.

### The reforms

**Two-child limit repeal**: The two-child limit restricts Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit payments to a maximum number of children per family. Removing this limit allows families to claim child-related benefit payments for all children without a cap. The Government estimates this will reduce child poverty by 450,000 by 2029-30. See our [research report](/uk/research/uk-two-child-limit) for details.

**Fuel duty freeze extension**: The baseline assumes the 5p cut ends on 22 March 2026, returning the rate to 57.95p, followed by RPI uprating from April 2026. The announced policy maintains the freeze at 52.95p until September 2026, then implements a staggered reversal with increases of 1p, 2p, and 2p over three-month periods, reaching 57.95p by March 2027. Both then apply annual RPI uprating. See our [research report](/uk/research/fuel-duty-freeze) for details.

**Rail fares freeze**: Freezes regulated rail fares in England for one year from March 2026 - the first freeze in 30 years. Without the freeze, fares would have increased by 5.8% under the RPI formula. The Government estimates this will save passengers £600 million in 2026-27, with commuters on expensive routes saving over £300 per year. See our [research report](/uk/research/rail-fares-freeze-2025) for details.

**Threshold freeze extension**: This policy extends the freeze on income tax thresholds from 2027-28 to 2030-31. The personal allowance remains frozen at £12,570, the higher-rate threshold at £50,270, and the additional-rate threshold at £125,140. The NICs secondary threshold is also frozen. By 2030-31, the [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates this will bring 5.2 million additional individuals into paying income tax.

**Dividend tax increase (+2pp)**: Increases dividend tax rates by 2 percentage points from April 2026. Basic rate: 8.75% to 10.75%, Higher rate: 33.75% to 35.75%. The additional rate remains at 39.35%. The [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates this will raise £1.0-1.1bn annually from 2027-28.

**Savings income tax increase (+2pp)**: Increases savings income tax rates by 2 percentage points from April 2027. Basic: 20% to 22%, Higher: 40% to 42%, Additional: 45% to 47%. The [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates this will raise £0.5bn annually from 2028-29.

**Property income tax increase (+2pp)**: Increases property income tax rates by 2 percentage points from April 2027. Basic: 20% to 22%, Higher: 40% to 42%, Additional: 45% to 47%. The [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates this will raise £0.4-0.6bn annually from 2028-29.

**Freeze student loan repayment thresholds**: Freezes the Plan 2 student loan repayment threshold at £29,385 for three years from April 2027, instead of allowing RPI uprating. This means graduates start repaying at a lower real income level, increasing repayments. The [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates this raises £255-355m annually from 2027-30.

**Salary sacrifice cap**: Caps National Insurance-free salary sacrifice pension contributions at £2,000 per year from April 2029. Contributions above this threshold become subject to employee and employer NICs. PolicyEngine estimates this will raise £3.3bn in 2029-30, assuming employers spread costs and employees maintain pension contributions. The [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) estimates £4.9bn (static) or £4.7bn (post-behavioural). See our [research report](/uk/research/uk-salary-sacrifice-cap) for details.

### Assumptions

Our analysis makes the following key assumptions:

- **Behavioural responses**: We [INCLUDE/EXCLUDE] behavioural responses [DESCRIPTION IF INCLUDED]
- **Employer NIC incidence**: [DESCRIPTION OF HOW EMPLOYER NIC CHANGES ARE MODELLED]
- **Baseline**: We compare against current law as of [DATE], including scheduled uprating
- **Data limitations**: FRS data may underreport savings income and property income; student loan data is based on [DESCRIPTION]

### Data

This analysis uses PolicyEngine's UK microsimulation model, which draws on:

- **Survey data**: Family Resources Survey (FRS) [YEAR], enhanced with administrative data
- **Calibration**: Weights are calibrated to match ONS population projections and HMRC tax statistics
- **Time period**: We model the combined reforms for fiscal years 2026-27 through 2029-30

## Economic impacts

### Revenue impact

We [estimate](LINK_TO_GIST) the combined revenue impact of all nine reforms across fiscal years. Table 1 compares our estimates with official [OBR](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/) projections where available.

## Conclusion

PolicyEngine estimates that the combined Autumn Budget 2025 reforms [RAISE/COST] £[X.X] billion in [YEAR]. [SUMMARY OF KEY DISTRIBUTIONAL FINDINGS - WHICH GROUPS GAIN/LOSE]. The reforms [INCREASE/REDUCE] income inequality by [X.XX]% as measured by the Gini index and [INCREASE/REDUCE] the overall poverty rate by [X.XX]%.

The two-child limit repeal and fuel duty freeze benefit lower-income households, while the tax increases on dividends, savings, and property income, along with the threshold freeze extension and salary sacrifice cap, primarily affect higher-income households.
