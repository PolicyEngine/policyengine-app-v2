PolicyEngine, in partnership with the [Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/), developed a [Rhode Island CTC Calculator](https://www.policyengine.org/us/rhode-island-ctc-calculator) to help policymakers analyze how different CTC designs would affect Rhode Island families and state revenues. Governor Dan McKee's office used the tool to evaluate reform options before finalizing the Child Tax Credit proposal.

## How we built the calculator

The Niskanen Center funded a project to explore converting Rhode Island's personal exemption for dependents into a Child Tax Credit. PolicyEngine built the calculator on the foundation of its existing analytical tools, leveraging its growing use of Claude Code to accelerate the development of the tool.

The Rhode Island CTC Calculator allows users to model how different Child Tax Credit parameters—including credit amounts, age eligibility, refundability, and phase-out structures—would affect both individual households and the state as a whole. Users can input their own household characteristics to see personalized impacts or examine statewide effects on state revenues, income distribution, and poverty.

This tool exemplifies PolicyEngine's approach to policy analysis: providing transparent, accessible modeling that empowers policymakers, advocates, and the public to understand the trade-offs inherent in policy design.

The Niskanen Center tested the calculator and used it to evaluate how different CTC parameters would affect Rhode Island households across the income distribution.

The Niskanen Center then shared the tool with Governor Dan McKee's office, which used the calculator to evaluate reform options and design the Child Tax Credit proposal included in his fiscal year 2027 budget.

> "I'm grateful to the PolicyEngine team for building the models that helped us see clearly how different policy choices would affect Rhode Island families. That ability to test options in real time strengthened our proposal and helped us design a Child Tax Credit that will deliver more than $30 million each year to the families who need it most."

## The Governor's proposal

On January 13th, Governor McKee announced the proposal during his State of the State address. The $325 fully refundable Child Tax Credit for children under 19 would:

- Cost the state $36.7 million
- Benefit 29.2% of Rhode Island residents
- Reduce child poverty by 2.1%

## Try it yourself

The same tool used by Governor McKee's office is available to the public. Whether you're a policymaker evaluating alternatives, an advocate assessing impacts on the populations you serve, or a Rhode Island resident curious about how reforms would affect your family, you can use the Rhode Island CTC Calculator to explore these questions yourself.

We invite policymakers and organizational leaders from other states interested in these types of tools to [reach out to us](mailto:hello@policyengine.org). We welcome the opportunity to work with you and build customized analytical tools to support your policy goals.
