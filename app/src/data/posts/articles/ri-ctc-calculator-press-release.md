PolicyEngine, in partnership with the [Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/), developed a Rhode Island Child Tax Credit Calculator to help policymakers analyze how different CTC designs would affect Rhode Island families and state revenues. Governor Dan McKee's office used the tool to evaluate reform options before finalizing the Child Tax Credit proposal included in his fiscal year 2027 budget, announced during his January 13th State of the State address.

> "I'm grateful to the PolicyEngine team for building the models that helped us see clearly how different policy choices would affect Rhode Island families. That ability to test options in real time strengthened our proposal and helped us design a Child Tax Credit that will deliver more than $30 million each year to the families who need it most."

## About the calculator

The [Rhode Island CTC Calculator](https://www.policyengine.org/us/rhode-island-ctc-calculator) allows users to model how different Child Tax Credit parameters—including credit amounts, age eligibility, refundability, and phase-out structures—would affect both individual households and the state as a whole. Users can input their own household characteristics to see personalized impacts or examine statewide effects on state revenues, income distribution, and poverty.

This tool exemplifies PolicyEngine's approach to policy analysis: providing transparent, accessible modeling that empowers policymakers, advocates, and the public to understand the trade-offs inherent in policy design.

## The Governor's proposal

Using the calculator, Governor McKee's office designed a $325 fully refundable Child Tax Credit for children under 19. According to PolicyEngine's modeling, the proposal would:

- Cost the state $36.7 million
- Benefit 29.2% of Rhode Island residents
- Reduce child poverty by 2.1%

## Try it yourself

The same tool used by Governor McKee's office is available to the public. Whether you're a policymaker evaluating alternatives, an advocate assessing impacts on the populations you serve, or a Rhode Island resident curious about how reforms would affect your family, the Rhode Island CTC Calculator provides the transparency and flexibility to explore these questions yourself.
