The [Illinois Benefit Hub](https://www.illinoisbenefithub.org/) has launched, bringing the MyFriendBen benefits screening platform to Illinois residents. This expansion makes Illinois the fourth state where MyFriendBen helps families identify potential financial support programs they may qualify for, following launches in Colorado, North Carolina, and New York.

## A partnership for Illinois families

Illinois Benefit Hub is an initiative of Benefit Illinois, a project working to increase public benefits enrollment in Illinois. The platform is [powered by MyFriendBen](https://myfriendben.org), which integrates with PolicyEngine's open-source API to calculate eligibility and benefit amounts for federal and state programs.

The tool offers Illinois residents a six-minute screener to check eligibility for dozens of public benefit programs at once, including food assistance, health insurance, child care subsidies, tax credits, and more. Beyond screening, Illinois Benefit Hub also provides application assistance to help users find organizations that can answer questions about benefit programs, program updates to keep residents informed about policy changes, and resource directories to find services in their community.

## PolicyEngine's role

Illinois Benefit Hub uses PolicyEngine's API to perform complex benefit calculations. Our models calculate eligibility and benefit amounts for programs like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, TANF, and federal and state tax credits including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.

This partnership exemplifies how PolicyEngine's open-source infrastructure can power user-facing tools that help families understand their financial options. By handling the computational complexity, we enable partners like MyFriendBen to focus on creating accessible experiences for the people who need them most.

## Open-source tools for developers
