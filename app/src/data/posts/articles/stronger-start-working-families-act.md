On January 8th, Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Todd Young (R-IN) introduced the [Stronger Start for Working Families Act](https://www.young.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/MCG25B67.pdf), bipartisan legislation that would eliminate the $2,500 earnings requirement before a household can receive the refundable portion of the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC).

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change.

Key results for 2026:

## Background

The Child Tax Credit provides up to $2,000 per qualifying child, with up to $1,700 of that amount refundable as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) in 2025. However, the refundable portion phases in at 15% of earned income above $2,500. This means families with very low earnings cannot access the full refundable credit.

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would eliminate this $2,500 threshold, allowing families to begin receiving the refundable CTC from their first dollar of earned income. 

## Household impacts

The reform primarily benefits lower-income families with children who do not receive the entire refundable portion of the CTC. Figure 1 displays the change in net income for a single parent with two children as earnings rise.

The maximum benefit any household can receive is $375, since the $2,500 earnings requirement is eliminated and the credit would no longer phase in at 15% over that range (15% × $2,500 = $375). This is true regardless of the number of dependents a household has. Additionally, due to the new immigration requirements enacted by HR 1, households without a valid SSN would not benefit from this policy change, as they are disqualified from receiving the CTC.

## Nationwide impacts

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would cost $789 million in 2026, according to [PolicyEngine's static modeling](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mk5steto8pe9?share=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). Over ten years, the bill would lower federal revenues by $[X] billion.

The reform would raise the net income of 3.4% of Americans. The percentage of people in each income decile who benefit varies, with beneficiaries concentrated in the lower income deciles.

The reform would provide an average benefit of $6 per household, with benefits also concentrated in the lowest income deciles.

We project that the Stronger Start for Working Families Act would reduce child poverty by 0.11%, as determined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure, while having no effect on deep child poverty. The proposed legislation would also reduce the Gini index of inequality by 0.017%.

## Conclusion

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would expand the Child Tax Credit's reach by eliminating the $2,500 earnings threshold. This reform would raise the net income of 3.4% of American residents, with a maximum benefit of $375 for those who currently receive less than the maximum refundable portion.
