On January 8th, Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Todd Young (R-IN) introduced the [Stronger Start for Working Families Act](https://www.young.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/MCG25B67.pdf). The bill would remove the $2,500 earnings requirement to receive the refundable portion of the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC), allowing the credit to phase in from the first dollar of earnings.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change.

Key results for 2026:

* Costs $789 million
* Benefits 3.4% of Americans
* Reduces child poverty by 0.11%
* Lowers the Gini index of inequality by 0.017%

## Background

The Child Tax Credit provides up to $2,200 per qualifying child, with up to $1,700 of that amount refundable as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) in 2026. However, the refundable portion phases in at 15% of earned income above $2,500. This means families with very low earnings cannot access the full refundable credit.

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would eliminate this $2,500 threshold, meaning families would begin receiving the refundable CTC from their first dollar of earned income. For example, a single parent with one child currently needs to earn $13,833 to receive the full $1,700 refundable credit ($1,700 ÷ 15% + $2,500 = $13,833). Under the reform, they would only need $11,333 of earnings to reach the maximum refundable amount ($1,700 ÷ 15% = $11,333).

## Household impacts

The reform primarily benefits lower-income families with children who do not receive the full refundable portion of the CTC. A single parent with two children earning $15,000 would see their net income increase by $375. Figure 1 displays the change in net income for this household as earnings rise.

The maximum benefit any household can receive is $375, regardless of the number of children (15% × $2,500 = $375). The benefit phases out once households reach their maximum refundable credit amount. For the single parent with two children shown in Figure 1, this phase-out occurs between $22,667 and $25,167 of employment income. Since the credit phases in at a flat 15% rate rather than 15% per child, households with more children reach their maximum refundable amount at higher income levels, pushing the phase-out range higher.

Additionally, due to immigration requirements enacted by HR 1, households without a valid Social Security number would not benefit from this policy, as they are ineligible for the CTC.

## Nationwide impacts

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would cost $789 million in 2026, according to [PolicyEngine's static modeling](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mk5steto8pe9?share=eyJ1c2VyUmVwb3J0Ijp7InJlcG9ydElkIjoiNDc3IiwiY291bnRyeUlkIjoidXMiLCJsYWJlbCI6IlN0cm9uZ2VyIFN0YXJ0IGZvciBXb3JraW5nIEZhbWlsaWVzIEFjdCIsImlzQ3JlYXRlZCI6dHJ1ZSwiaWQiOiJzdXItbWs1c3RldG84cGU5In0sInVzZXJTaW11bGF0aW9ucyI6W3sic2ltdWxhdGlvbklkIjoiNzEiLCJjb3VudHJ5SWQiOiJ1cyIsImxhYmVsIjoiVW5pdGVkIFN0YXRlcyBjdXJyZW50IGxhdyBmb3IgYWxsIGhvdXNlaG9sZHMgbmF0aW9ud2lkZSIsImlzQ3JlYXRlZCI6dHJ1ZSwiaWQiOiJzdXMtbWs1c3NqdGZhMXVmIn0seyJzaW11bGF0aW9uSWQiOiI1MzUiLCJjb3VudHJ5SWQiOiJ1cyIsImxhYmVsIjoiU3Ryb25nZXIgU3RhcnQgZm9yIFdvcmtpbmcgRmFtaWxpZXMgQWN0IHJlZm9ybSBzaW11bGF0aW9uIiwiaXNDcmVhdGVkIjp0cnVlLCJpZCI6InN1cy1tazVzdGQ1eDE0Y28ifV0sInVzZXJQb2xpY2llcyI6W3sicG9saWN5SWQiOjg1NTg3LCJjb3VudHJ5SWQiOiJ1cyIsImxhYmVsIjoiU3Ryb25nZXIgU3RhcnQgZm9yIFdvcmtpbmcgRmFtaWxpZXMgQWN0IHJlZm9ybSBwb2xpY3kiLCJpc0NyZWF0ZWQiOnRydWUsImlkIjoic3VwLW1rNXN0OHl3ZzI1ZiJ9XSwidXNlckhvdXNlaG9sZHMiOltdLCJ1c2VyR2VvZ3JhcGhpZXMiOlt7ImlkIjoiYW5vbnltb3VzLTE3Njc4OTc5NDg1NjIiLCJjb3VudHJ5SWQiOiJ1cyIsImdlb2dyYXBoeUlkIjo). Over ten years, the bill would lower federal revenues by $8.6 billion.

The reform would raise the net income of 3.4% of Americans, with beneficiaries concentrated in the lower income deciles. Figure 2 shows the share of residents in each income decile that would gain from the reform.

We project that the Stronger Start for Working Families Act would reduce child poverty by 0.11%, as determined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure, while having no effect on deep child poverty. The proposed legislation would also reduce the Gini index of inequality by 0.017%.

## Conclusion

The Stronger Start for Working Families Act would expand the Child Tax Credit's reach by eliminating the $2,500 earnings threshold. This reform would raise the net income of 3.4% of American residents, with a maximum benefit of $375 for those who currently receive less than the maximum refundable portion.
