South Carolina's [House Bill 3492](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess126_2025-2026/prever/3492_20241205.htm) would make the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) partially refundable. South Carolina currently matches 125% of the federal EITC (the highest rate in the nation), but the credit is entirely nonrefundable, meaning filers who owe little or no state income tax cannot claim its full value. H.3492 would allow taxpayers to receive 25% of the credit that exceeds their tax liability as a refund.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change on South Carolina and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

- Costs the state $403 million
- Benefits 23.3% of South Carolina residents
- Reduces poverty by 2.1%
- Lowers the Gini index of income inequality by 0.41%

## Household impacts

Making 25% of the excess EITC refundable could yield gains for families with little tax obligation. For example, a filer with $3,000 in taxes owed can only claim up to that amount from a nonrefundable EITC, even if they qualify for $5,000. Under the reform, they would obtain a refund of 25% of the remainder, or $500 ($2,000 x 25% = $500).

Let's examine how H.3492 affects a single parent with one child in South Carolina. At $20,000 of earnings, they receive no savings from the nonrefundable EITC, despite qualifying for a credit of $5,533. However, under H.3492, their net income increases by $1,383 as they collect 25% of the surplus, in this case, 25% of their eligible amount. Figure 1 displays the change in net income for a single parent with one child as employment earnings rise from $0 to $200,000.

## Statewide impacts

For tax year 2026, H.3492 would [cost the state $403 million](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mkr6zuakk0g9?share=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) according to PolicyEngine's static modeling.

The proposal would raise the net income of 23.3% of South Carolina residents, with gains concentrated among those in the bottom half of the state's income distribution. Additionally, 9.6% of residents would see an increase of over 5% in their net income, including 36% of those in the 2nd income decile.

H.3492 would provide an average benefit of $210 per South Carolina household. Tax savings are concentrated in deciles 2 through 4, with benefits falling as household income rises.

We project that H.3492 would reduce poverty by 2.1% and child poverty by 4.8%. The larger child poverty reduction reflects the structure of the federal EITC, which provides a higher benefit amount to families with children.

## Conclusion

H.3492, which makes 25% of South Carolina's excess EITC refundable, would cost $403 million in tax year 2026. Nearly one-quarter of residents would benefit, with gains concentrated in the bottom half of the income distribution. The bill would reduce child poverty by 4.8% statewide and lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.41% in the state.
