South Carolina's [House Bill 3492](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess126_2025-2026/prever/3492_20241205.htm) proposes to alter the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Currently, South Carolina offers a 125% nonrefundable match of the federal EITC, the highest state EITC match in the nation on paper. However, because the credit is entirely nonrefundable, low-income filers with little or no state tax liability receive less actual benefit than appears. H.3492 would make 25% of the excess credit (the portion exceeding tax liability) refundable.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change on South Carolina and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

- Costs the state $403 million
- Benefits 23.3% of South Carolina residents
- Reduces poverty by 2.1%
- Lowers the Gini index of income inequality by 0.41%

## The reform

South Carolina's current EITC structure illustrates a common limitation of nonrefundable tax credits. While the state nominally matches 125% of the federal EITC, most recipients see only a fraction of this benefit because their state tax liability is too low to absorb the full credit amount.

H.3492 addresses this by making 25% of the excess credit refundable. This means that when a filer's 125% state EITC exceeds their state income tax liability, they would receive 25% of that excess as a refund rather than losing it entirely.

The mathematics reveal why this reform carries a substantial price tag: 25% of the 125% match equals 31.25% of the federal EITC. Given that most EITC recipients have near-zero South Carolina tax liability, essentially the full 31.25% becomes newly available—which explains how the $403 million cost closely matches what would be expected from a straightforward 31.25% refundable federal EITC match.

## Household impacts

Let's examine how H.3492 affects a single parent with one child in South Carolina. The benefit is concentrated among low-income workers who qualify for the federal EITC. Figure 1 displays the change in net income as employment earnings rise from $0 to $200,000.

## Statewide impacts

For tax year 2026, H.3492 would [cost the state $403 million](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mkr6zuakk0g9?share=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) according to PolicyEngine's static modeling.

The reform would benefit 23.3% of South Carolina residents, with gains heavily concentrated among lower-income households. Unlike tax rate reductions that primarily benefit higher earners, this EITC reform directs resources to working families in the bottom half of the income distribution.

H.3492 would provide an average benefit that decreases with income, ranging from the largest gains in the bottom deciles to near-zero in the top deciles.

We project that H.3492 would reduce poverty by 2.1% and child poverty by 4.8%. The larger child poverty reduction reflects the structure of the federal EITC, which provides greater benefits to families with children.

## Conclusion

H.3492 would transform South Carolina's state EITC from a largely symbolic benefit into meaningful support for low-income working families. The reform effectively unlocks the "dead" credit value that currently exceeds most recipients' tax liability, converting paper generosity into actual household income.
