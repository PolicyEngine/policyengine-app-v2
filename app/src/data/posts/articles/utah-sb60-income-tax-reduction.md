On January 7th, Senator Daniel McCray (R-Riverton) submitted [SB60](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/SB0060.html) to the Utah State Senate. The bill proposes reducing Utah's flat income tax rate from 4.5% to 4.45%, beginning in tax year 2026. This would continue Utah's trend of income tax cuts, marking the fifth consecutive year of rate reductions since the tax rate stood at 4.95% in 2021.

We at PolicyEngine have analyzed the effects of this proposed change on the state of Utah and its residents.

Key results for 2026:

* Reduces state revenues by $83.6 million
* Benefits 53.2% of Utah residents
* Has no effect on the Supplemental Poverty Measure
* Raises the Gini index of inequality by 0.01%

## Tax reform

SB60's proposed 0.05 percentage point reduction would continue the state's pattern of annual income tax cuts. Since 2021, Utah's tax rate has dropped from 4.95% to 4.85% in 2022, 4.65% in 2023, 4.55% in 2024, and 4.5% in 2025.

Unlike the [2025 tax package](https://www.policyengine.org/us/research/utah-income-tax-changes) which included multiple provisions affecting the Child Tax Credit and Social Security credit, SB60 focuses solely on the rate reduction.[^1]

[^1]: SB60 also reduces the state's corporate tax rate to 4.45%. We did not include this provision in our analysis.

## Household impacts

Let's examine how SB60 affects a single adult's net income in Utah. Due to interactions with the Utah taxpayer credit, this household does not benefit with earnings below $20,500. Above this threshold, the taxpayer credit begins to phase out, and tax savings become proportional to earnings. For example, [at $80,000 of earnings](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mk70207zzf9k), the single adult would see their Utah income tax liability decrease by $40. Figure 1 displays the change in net income for a single adult as earnings rise.

## Statewide impacts

For tax year 2026, SB60 would reduce state revenues by $83.6 million, according to [PolicyEngine's static modeling](https://app.policyengine.org/us/report-output/sur-mk5j6k3z4m3o?share=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).

The tax cut would raise the net income of 53.2% of residents in Utah. The percentage of residents in each income decile who are net beneficiaries varies, with residents in higher-income deciles more likely to benefit since they have greater taxable income.

SB60 would provide an average benefit of $130 per household, ranging from $5 in the bottom income decile to $583 in the top decile.

We project that SB60 would have no effect on poverty or deep poverty while raising the state's Gini index of inequality by 0.01%.

## Conclusion

SB60 would continue Utah's trend of annual income tax reductions by lowering the flat rate from 4.5% to 4.45% beginning in 2026. The proposal would reduce state revenues while providing tax savings to a majority of Utah taxpayers, with higher-income households receiving larger absolute benefits due to the nature of flat-rate income tax cuts.
