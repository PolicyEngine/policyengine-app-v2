Where would a mansion tax hit hardest?

We mapped 2024 property sales above £2m by UK constituency. Three central London seats—Cities of London & Westminster, Kensington & Bayswater, and Chelsea & Fulham—account for 21% of all high-value sales nationwide.

Ahead of tomorrow's Autumn Budget, we mapped where a mansion tax would concentrate.

Using Land Registry data, we identified 8,213 property sales above £2 million in 2024—just 0.9% of all transactions. The geographic concentration is stark: three central London constituencies alone account for a fifth of these sales.

Key findings:
• Raising the threshold from £1.5m to £2m nearly halves affected properties (14,820 → 8,213)
• London constituencies account for 45-46% of high-value sales
• The median constituency saw just 6 sales above £2m

The interactive map lets you search any constituency and toggle between thresholds.
